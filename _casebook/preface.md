## Layout and Design Features 

### Sidenotes & Margin Notes 

Following the typographical style of [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/), this site uses sidenotes and margin notes in place of traditional footnotes or endnotes. These appear in the right-hand margin, avoiding the need to jump through hyperlinks. On this site, numbered sidenotes[^sidenote] are used for footnotes in the source materials (with original note numbering indicated in parentheses). Unnumbered margin notes,[^marginnote] in <span class="sans-green">green sans-serif typeface</span>, are used for editor's comments. On mobile devices, sidenotes and margin notes may initially be hidden; clicking on the indicator for a sidenote (<span class="dullred">[1]</span>) or margin note (&#8853;) will reveal the note. 

[^sidenote]: This is an example of a sidenote. 

[^marginnote]: 
  {-} This is an example of a margin note. 

### Page Navigation 

At the top of the page for each chapter, there is a drop-down "Page Navigation" menu. Hovering over this will reveal a list of numbered sections and sub-sections, and clicking on these will scroll to the approiate location on the page. On mobile devices, you can click on the menu icon <img src="../assets/img/menu.png" width="16"> to reveal the Page Navigation menu.
