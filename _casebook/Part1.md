# 1.1 Introduction to Professional Responsibility

Welcome to _Professional Responsibility_. Contrary to conventional wisdom among law students, this is one of the most important classes you will take in law school. It is the only class explicitly required by the American Bar Association ("ABA"), and also the subject of the [Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination](https://www.ncbex.org/exams/mpre/) ("MPRE"), a test that the overwhelming majority of law school graduates must pass in order to become a member of their state bar association.[^bb58e403]

[^bb58e403]: Wisconsin and Puerto Rico currently do not require the MPRE for bar membership. Connecticut and New Jersey currently accept successful completion of a law school course on professional responsibility in lieu of the MPRE. 

But that is the least of it. This class on professional responsibility will enable you to practice law consistent with the law governing lawyers and other professional obligations. And it will help you ensure that you are never the subject of a disciplinary action or sanction from the bar or the courts. In other words, this class could be your life, or at least your livelihood. Take it seriously, because the rules, principles, and obligations you learn about in this class will govern everything you do as an attorney.  

## What is "Professional Responsibility"? 

Professional responsibility is the only class that the ABA explicitly requires law schools to provide in order to qualify for accreditation. Under the [ABA's 2018-2019 Standards and Rules of Procedure for Approval of Law Schools](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/legal_education/resources/standards/), "A law school shall maintain a rigorous program of legal education that prepares its students, upon graduation, for admission to the bar and for effective, ethical, and responsible participation as members of the legal profession." Standard 301(a). Accordingly, "A law school shall establish learning outcomes that shall, at a minimum, include competency in the exercise of proper professional and ethical responsibilities to clients and the legal system, and other professional skills needed for competent and ethical participation as a member of the legal profession." Standard 302(c) & (d). And in order to satisfy that requirement, "A law school shall offer a curriculum that requires each student to satisfactorily complete at least one course of at least two credit hours in professional responsibility that includes substantial instruction in rules of professional conduct, and the values and responsibilities of the legal profession and its members." Standard 303(a)(1). 

However, law schools and law professors retain considerable discretion in how they teach professional responsibility. While the ABA accreditation standards provide that law schools must require a professional responsibility class, they do not specify what subjects the class must cover or how it should be taught. Unsurprisingly, law schools typically delegate those decisions to law professors, who have adopted a wide range of different approaches. Some classes focus on the ABA's [Model Rules of Professional Conduct](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/model_rules_of_professional_conduct_table_of_contents/) and how courts use them to regulate attorneys. Other classes focus on the concept of legal ethics and the justification of the legal profession. And still other classes focus on how attorneys actually comply with rules of professional conduct in practice. 

This casebook is designed for a class focused on the Model Rules of Professional Conduct and their practical application. Each chapter of the book addresses a different issue, in the following format. First, it clearly and concisely explains the relevant law governing that issue. Then provides the relevant text of any statutes, Model Rules, sections of the Restatement of the Law Governing Lawyers, or other sources, with a link to an open-source versions of the full text, when available. It provides one or more heavily edited cases intended to illustrate the application of the law at issue, with a link to an open-source version of the full text of the case. Each case is preceded by a brief summary of its facts, reasoning, and holding, and followed by questions intended to indicate subjects for further investigation or discussion. And finally, it includes citations to law review articles and other materials relevant to the law at issue, with links to open-source versions of those materials, when available. 

## Legal Ethics v. The Regulation of Legal Practice 

Different lawyers think about professional responsibility in different ways, different law professors teach professional responsibility in different ways, and different legal scholars conceptualize professional responsibility in different ways. Some attorneys, professors, and scholars see professional responsibility as the practice of legal ethics. In other words, they believe that the rules of professional responsibility are expressions of ethical principles, and the legitimacy of those rules depends on the legitimacy of the ethical principles they express. But other attorneys, professors, and scholars see professional responsibility as merely the regulation of legal practice. In other words, they believe that the rules of professional responsibility are just the positive law governing attorneys.  

### Legal Ethics 

Legal ethics can be either descriptive or normative. While both descriptive and normative legal ethics investigate the ethical values motivating the law of professional responsibility, they do so in very different ways, with fundamentally different goals. Descriptive legal ethics asks what the ethical values of law of professional responsibility are; normative legal ethics asks what they should be. 

Descriptive legal ethics assumes that the statutes and rules governing the practice of law, as well as the cases interpreting and applying those statutes and rules, effectively express the ethical values of the legal profession. Accordingly, by studying the law of professional responsibility in action, one can identify the ethical values inherent in the law that motivate its articulation, interpretation, and application. 

Normative legal ethics asks whether the law of professional responsibility expresses a true moral theory. In other words, it starts with a moral theory, and asks whether the law of professional responsibility produces results consistent with that theory. Of course, different normative theories of legal ethics may adopt different moral theories. But they all assume that the purpose of the law of professional responsibility is to produce moral outcomes. Accordingly, the law of professional responsibility is justified if it expresses a true moral theory, and unjustified if it does not.  

### The Regulation of Legal Practice 

This casebook focuses on the regulation of legal practice, not legal ethics. The primary purpose of this casebook is to help you better understand how the bar and the courts actually apply the statutes and rules governing the practice of law. While this casebook is not a study guide for the MPRE, it should help you better understand the questions on the MPRE and how to answer them correctly. 

The various bar associations, often in conjunction with the courts, adopt disciplinary rules regulating legal practice. Some of those rules are mandatory, and define what attorneys must and must not do. Other rules are discretionary, and describe what attorneys may and may not do. And still other rules are aspirational, and explain what attorneys should and should not do. 

When the courts consider a complaint against an attorney, they typically apply the disciplinary rules adopted by the bar association, in light of generally applicable legal principles. In other words, they ask not only whether the attorney violated the letter or spirit of the disciplinary rules, but also whether the rules at issue are valid and enforceable. However, a court may find that an attorney who has not violated the disciplinary rules has still violated some other legal duty. 

Accordingly, this casebook focuses on describing the law of professional responsibility, explaining how it has been applied, and asking whether it was applied correctly. However, the law of professional responsibility differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Sometimes those differences are minor, but other times they are fundamental. This casebook focuses of describing, explaining, and reflecting on the application of the most paradigmatic rules, as exemplified by the Model Rules of Professional Conduct and the Restatement of the Law Governing Lawyers. 

Of course, studying an area of law inevitably provokes reflections on its purpose and justification. Even a casebook devoted to the study of the regulation of legal practice cannot avoid implicating questions of legal ethics. What values does the law of professional responsibility express? Are those values justified? What makes a rule of professional conduct justified or unjustified? What is the purpose of the law of professional responsibility? All of these ethical issues are implicit in the subject matter of this class. But they are not the subject matter of this casebook. Or at the very least, while this casebook may directly or indirectly raise those questions, it does not purport to answer them or take a position on how they should be answered. 

## Model Rules of Professional Conduct: Preamble & Scope  


##### Questions 

1. What are these two sections of the Model Rules intended to accomplish? 

2. Does the Preamble seem to describe disciplinary rules, ethical rules, or both? What about the section on the scope of the Model Rules? 

3. Does the Preamble suggest that the Model Rules provide ethical guidance for attorneys? What about the section on scope?  

## The Duty of Zealous Representation 

Perhaps the most fundamental duty of an attorney is the duty of "zealous representation." Attorneys must represent the interests of their clients to the best of their ability and to the extent permitted by the law. And attorneys must always advocate for their client's interests, to the exclusion of anyone else's interests, including their own. Specifically, attorneys must zealously represent their client's interests, even at their own expense. 

But the duty of zealous representation can conflict with an attorney's other duties, especially an attorney's duties to the court. As members of the bar, attorneys are also officers of the court. Among other things, they owe the court a duty of candor. But sometimes an attorney's duty of zealous representation can conflict with the duty of candor. For example, the duty of zealous representation may require attorneys to avoid or minimize evidence that is detrimental to their clients. But the duty of candor may require attorneys to disclose that same evidence to the court. 

Canon 7 of the [ABA Model Code of Professional Responsibility (1980)](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/professional_responsibility/mrpc_migrated/mcpr.pdf) stated that "a lawyer should represent a client zealously within the bounds of the law." Ethical Consideration 7-1 provided, "The duty of a lawyer, both to his client and to the legal system, is to represent his client zealously within the bounds of the law, which includes Disciplinary Rules and enforceable professional regulations." Among other things, Disciplinary Rule 7-101 (A) provided, "A lawyer shall not intentionally fail to seek the lawful objectives of his client through reasonably available means permitted by law and the Disciplinary Rules." 

When the ABA adopted the [Model Rules of Professional Conduct](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/model_rules_of_professional_conduct_table_of_contents/) in 1983, it did not use the term "zealous representation." Instead, Model Rule 1.3 provided, "A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client." However, Comment 11 observed: 

> A lawyer should pursue a matter on behalf of a client despite opposition, obstruction or personal inconvenience to the lawyer, and take whatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client's cause or endeavor. A lawyer must also act with commitment and dedication to the interests of the client and with zeal in advocacy upon the client's behalf. A lawyer is not bound, however, to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client. For example, a lawyer may have authority to exercise professional discretion in determining the means by which a matter should be pursued.  

The lawyer's duty to act with reasonable diligence does not require the use of offensive tactics or preclude the treating of all persons involved in the legal process with courtesy and respect. 

Today, courts and scholars continue to refer to an attorney's "duty of zealous representation." What is the scope of that duty? What should it be? How should attorneys and courts balance the duty of zealous representation against an attorney's duties to the court and to society as a whole?  

##### Questions

1. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, President Bush asked the Office of Legal Counsel for its opinion on the legality of certain interrogation techniques. OLC produced several memoranda arguing that the techniques were legal under domestic and international law, which ultimately became known as the "torture memos." The torture memos were almost universally condemned by policymakers and legal scholars as both immoral and incorrect statements of the governing law. Should OLC have produced the memos? Was it a violation of the rules of professional conduct for OLC to make arguments based on inaccurate interpretations of the law. Was it a violation of legal ethics for OLC to make arguments in favor of the interrogation techniques? Would it have been a violation of legal ethics if those techniques were in fact legal? Would it have been a violation of the rules of professional conduct for OLC to produce memos presenting arguments both for and against the legality of the interrogation techniques?  


## Torres v. Donnelly, 554 F. 3d 322 (2d Cir. 2009) 


##### Questions

1. Could Keefe have relied on Rodriguez's testimony without violating his duty of candor to the court? What if the prosecutor did not notice the mistake? Would Keefe have a duty to disclose? Would it be a violation of the Model Rules if he did not disclose? 

2. What are Keefe's ethical obligations under the circumstances? How should he balance his duty to Torres against his duty to the court?  


# 1.2 A Brief History of the American Legal Profession}

## The Profession before the 1908 Ethics Rules 

The American legal profession was significantly unregulated for most of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In fact, applying contemporary definitions in which a profession is selfregulating, it is not clear lawyers' work during this time was part of a unified legal profession at all. That's not to say lawyers did not play an important role in American society. Lawyers fulfilled not just one, but two equally important roles: as advocates for their clients and agents of the court. Before the organized American legal profession with formal rules, this dual-role model of lawyering shaped how lawyers thought about their professional responsibilities and standards for their conduct. 

Many lawyers' everyday work primarily concerned advocating for the private interests of clients. Eighteenth and nineteenth century clients sought out lawyers for many of the same reasons people obtain lawyers today, including settling disputes over personal property, navigating commercial matters, and resolving all sorts of other conflicts between people. Although some of the events leading people to seek lawyer's assistance may seem familiar, the social, economic, and political conditions of the nineteenth century meant even this familiar role was anything but routine. 

The time period between the American Revolution and the twentieth century was full of dramatic changes in the law, the work of lawyering, and the legal profession. The law itself became more voluminous and complex, beginning with post-Revolution efforts to create orderly state and federal governments. As the country rapidly grew and and industrialized, new types of activity and disputes emerged, creating new demands for legal intervention. 

Lawrence Friedman's A History of American Law summarizes: 

> What happened to American law in the nineteenth century, basically, was that it changed dramatically, fundamentally, to conform to the needs, wants, and pressures coming from the vast increase in the numbers of consumers of law. It is dangerous to sum up long periods and great movements in a sentence. But if colonial law had been, in the first place, colonial, and in the second place, paternal, emphasizing community, order, and the struggle against sin, then, gradually, a new set of attitudes developed, in which the primary function of law was not suppression and uniformity, but economic growth and services to its users. 

Instrumentalist theories about law combined with a rapidly changing industrial society contributed to the idea that practicing judges, lawyers, and scholars could actively shape the world they worked in. Often this was in response to their work for the private interests of clients, although records of conversations among lawyers show continued concern for and attention to their public responsibilities as well.  

##### Question: 

- Is the dual-role model of lawyers' responsibilities useful for navigating professional ethical dilemmas? Based on what you know about lawyers' work, try to think of at least one scenario in which it would be helpful and one in which it might not be. 

## American Bar Association's Ethics Rules 

The American Bar Association, founded in 1878, advanced its first attempt at a uniform standard of conduct for lawyers in 1908. The Canons of Professional Ethics were intended to be a general guide for lawyers, based on existing professional norms expressed in legal ethics scholarship and some state bar association literature. The ABA acknowledged the idealistic nature of the Canons, and did not intend for them to be enforceable. For an overview of the Canons, see the Preamble and the list of Canons, below, from the Final Committee Report on 1908 ABA Ethics Rules. 

### Canons of Ethics 

_Preamble_

In America, where the stability of Courts and of all departments of government rests upon the approval of the people, it is peculiarly essential that the system for establishing and dispensing justice be developed to a high point of efficiency and so maintained that the public shall have absolute confidence in the integrity and impartiality of its administration. The future of the republic, to a great extent, depends upon our maintenance of justice pure and unsullied. It cannot be so maintained unless the conduct and the motives of the members of our profession are such as to merit the approval of all just men. 

_The Canons of Ethics _

No code or set of rules can be framed, which will particularize all the duties of the lawyer in the varying phases of litigation or in all the relations of professional life. The following canons of ethics are adopted by the American Bar Association as a general guide, yet the enumeration of particular duties should not be construed as a denial of the existence of others equally imperative, though not specifically mentioned: 

1. The Duty of the Lawyer to the Courts.
2. The Selection of Judges.
3. Attempts to Exert Personal Influence on the Courts.
4. When Counsel for an Indigent Prisoner. 
5. The Defense or Prosecution of Those Accused of Crime. 
6. Adverse Influences and Conflicting Interests. 
7. Professional Colleagues and Conflicts of Opinion. 
8. Advising Upon the Merits of a Client's Cause. 
9. Negotiations with Opposite Party. 
10. Acquiring Interest in Litigation. 
11. Dealing with Trust Property. 
12. Fixing the Amount of the Fee. 
13. Contingent Fees. 
14. Suing a Client for a Fee. 
15. How Far a Lawyer May Go in Supporting a Client's Cause. 
16. Restraining Clients from Improprieties. 
17. Ill Feeling and Personalities Between Advocates. 
18. Treatment of Witnesses and Litigants. 
19. Appearance of Lawyer as Witness for His Client. 
20. Newspaper Discussion of Pending Litigation. 
21. Punctuality and Expedition. 
22. Candor and Fairness. 
23. Attitude Toward Jury. 
24. Right of Lawyers to Control the Incidents of the Trial. 
25. Taking Technical Advantage of Opposite Counsel; Agreements with Him. 
26. Professional Advocacy Other Than Before Courts. 
27. Advertising, Direct or Indirect. 
28. Stirring Up Litigation, Directly or Through Agents. 
29. Upholding the Honor of the Profession. 
30. Justifiable and Unjustifiable Litigations. 
31. Responsibility for Litigation. 
32. The Lawyer's Duty in Its Last Analysis.  

##### Questions: 

- Do you see evidence of dual-role model of lawyers' responsibilities in the Canons? Where? 
- What does the adoption of the Canons tell us about the state of the profession in 1908? 

Although the Canons were general statements of profession norms, they included some explanatory content. For example, see Canons 4, 17, and 29. 

_Canon 4—When Counsel for an Indigent Prisoner._ A lawyer assigned as counsel for an indigent prisoner ought not to ask to be excused for any trivial reason, and should always exert his best efforts in his behalf. 

_Canon 17- III Feeling and Personalities Between Advocates._ Clients, not lawyers, are the litigants. Whatever may be the ill feeling existing between clients, it should not be allowed to influence counsel in their conduct and demeanor toward each other or toward suitors in the case. All personalities between counsel should be scrupulously avoided. In the trial of a cause it is indecent to allude to the personal history or the personal peculiarities and idiosyncrasies of counsel on the other side. Personal colloquies between counsel which cause delay and promote unseemly wrangling should also be carefully avoided. 

_Canon 29—Upholding the Honor of the Profession._ Lawyers should expose without fear or favor before the proper tribunals corrupt or dishonest conduct in the profession, and should accept without hesitation employment against a member of the Bar who has wronged his client. The counsel upon the trial of a cause in which perjury has been committed owe it to the profession and citing authorities. The lawyer should aid in guarding the Bar against admission to the profession of candidates unfit or unqualified because deficient in either moral character or education. He should strive at all times to uphold the honor and to maintain the dignity of the profession and to improve not only the law but the administration of justice.  

##### Questions: 

- Are the Canons useful for navigating professional ethical dilemmas? 
- How helpful is the explanatory content? Does it answer all your questions about how to apply the Canons? Can you think of a situation in which lawyers might reasonably disagree about what conforming professional conduct might look like? 

The ABA Canons of Professional Ethics were an important step towards professionalizing lawyers' work. While no longer in force, the Canons guided lawyers' professional standards for a sixty year period in which the modern profession emerged. Judicial opinions and state bars often referred to the text of and principles in the Canons. Attempts to apply the Canons revealed some challenges with moving from generalized principles to enforceable boundaries, prompting the ABA to work towards the Model Code of Professional Responsibility.  

### Model Code of Professional Responsibility 

The ABA House of Delegates approved the Model Code of Professional Responsibility, a comprehensively revised set of rules, on August 12, 1969. The Model Code marked a significant shift from the Canons in its organization and scope. Where the Canons were idealistic and relied on external judgments to clarify conflicting priorities and refine broad goals, the Model Code contained three distinct but interrelated parts: canons, ethical considerations, and disciplinary rules. The canons stated the general rules which led to the ethical considerations and disciplinary rules. The ethical considerations were the aspirational principles. The disciplinary rules were mandatory statements about the minimum standards of conduct lawyers must adhere to in order to not face disciplinary action. Each canon might contain a dozen (or more!) ethical considerations and disciplinary rules. 

For Example, explanatory content for Canon 6 includes six ethical considerations and two disciplinary rules. 

#### CANON 6: A Lawyer Should Represent a Client Competently

_ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS_

_EC 6-1_

Because of his vital role in the legal process, a lawyer should act with competence and proper care in representing clients. He should strive to become and remain proficient in his practice and should accept employment only in matters which he is or intends to become competent to handle. 

_EC 6-2_

A lawyer is aided in attaining and maintaining his competence by keeping abreast of current legal literature and developments, participating in continuing legal education programs, concentrating in particular areas of the law, and by utilizing other available means. He has the additional ethical obligation to assist in improving the legal profession, and he may do so by participating in bar activities intended to advance the quality and standards of members of the profession. Of particular importance is the careful training of his younger associates and the giving of sound guidance to all lawyers who consult him. In short, a lawyer should strive at all levels to aid the legal profession in advancing the highest possible standards of integrity and competence and to meet those standards himself. 

_EC 6-3_

While the licensing of a lawyer is evidence that he has met the standards then prevailing for admission to the bar, a lawyer generally should not accept employment in any area of the law in which he is not qualified. However, he may accept such employment if in good faith he expects to become qualified through study and investigation, as long as such preparation would not result in unreasonable delay or expense to his client. Proper preparation and representation may require the association by the lawyer of professionals in other disciplines. A lawyer offered employment in a matter in which he is not and does not expect to become so qualified should either decline the employment or, with the consent of his client, accept the employment and associate a lawyer who is competent in the matter. 

_EC 6-4_

Having undertaken representation, a lawyer should use proper care to safeguard the Interests of his client. If a lawyer has accepted employment in a matter beyond his competence but in which he expected to become competent, he should diligently undertake the work and study necessary to qualify himself. In addition to being qualified to handle a particular matter, his obligation to his client requires him to prepare adequately for and give appropriate attention to his legal work. 

_EC 6-5_

A lawyer should have pride in his professional endeavors. His obligation to act competently calls for higher motivation than that arising from fear of civil liability or disciplinary penalty. 

_EC 6-6_

A lawyer should not seek, by contract or other means, to limit his individual liability to his client for his malpractice. A lawyer who handles the affairs of his client properly has no need to attempt to limit his liability for his professional activities and one who does not handle the affairs of his client properly should not be permitted to do so. A lawyer who is a stockholder in or is associated with a professional legal corporation may, however, limit his liability for malpractice of his associates in the corporation, but only to the extent permitted by law. 

_DISCIPLINARY RULES_

_DR 6-101-Failing to Act Competently._

A. A lawyer shall not: 

1. Handle a legal matter which he knows or should know that he is not competent to handle, without associating with him a lawyer who is competent to handle it. 
2. Handle a legal matter without preparation adequate in the circumstances. 
3. Neglect a legal matter entrusted to him. 

_DR 6-102-Limiting Liability to Client._

A. A lawyer shall not attempt to exonerate himself from or limit his liability to his client for his personal malpractice.  

##### Questions: 

- How useful is the Model Code for making decisions about professional conduct? Is the clarification between canons, ethical considerations, and disciplinary rules an improvement on the 1908 Canons? 
- Is it necessary to have canons, ethical considerations, and disciplinary rules? Consider each statement's or rule's usefulness in lawyers' various roles and practice settings. 

The Model Code, in various forms and versions, was the ABA's central document on professional responsibility from 1970 through 1981. While no longer in use, it's important to know about the Model Code. Many important cases decided during this time and some states' rules still contain references to and evidence of the influence of the Model Code.  

### Model Rules of Professional Conduct 

The shift from idealistic Canons to boundary rules in the Model Code created the need for specificity the Model Code did not always address. To deal with this challenge, the ABA tasked a lawyer named Robert Kutak with chairing a commission to study the problem. The Kutak Commission focused on developing the minimum standards of conduct for lawyers into a series of black-letter rules. The resulting Model Rules, adopted in 1983, are the basis of the current [Model Rules of Professional Conduct](LINK). The Model Rules have a regulatory structure, with a statement of minimum conduct and explanatory comments. The official comments are similar to other regulatory comments, in that they might content information about the reasoning behind a rule or examples to guide application. Like other model rules, the Model Rules of Professional Conduct are not themselves binding. They are designed to be examples a state may choose to adopt into law. For an example from the Model Rules, see the Rule 1:1 on Competence, below. 

## Rule 1.1: Competence 


### Adoption of the Model Rules 

States adopted the structure of the model rules fairly quickly. Today, almost all states' disciplinary rules follow the numbering system of the Model Rules. The content of state rules varies, so it's important to follow the law of your jurisdiction. Since the Model Rules of Professional Conduct have been so influential, lawyers can look to these Model Rules just like they might look to other uniform laws or model acts.  

##### Questions: 

- In Rule 1.1 above, do the comments change your understanding of the rule? How? Do you have remaining questions about what the rule means or how it might work in application? 
- Compare the usefulness of the Model Rules to the Model Code and the Canons. Consider the regulatory structure of the Model Rules, the distinction between ideals and boundaries, and the content in the examples above.
