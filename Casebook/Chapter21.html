<h3 class="secmain" id="int1-21"><span class="bold">Introduction</span></h3>
<p class="image-lensL"><img src="../Casebook/images/ltt.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="noindent1">Lawyers do not supervise only other lawyers. On the contrary, most lawyers, even during the beginning stages of a legal career, regularly work with and supervise non-lawyer assistants, such as office staff, investigators, social workers, retained experts, paralegals, law student interns, and many other professionals who empower a lawyer&#x2019;s work for clients. These assistants may be employees of the lawyer&#x2019;s own law firm, independent contractors retained for a specific matter, or outside businesses to whom the lawyer has referred a project.</p>
<p class="clear"></p>
<p class="noindent1">As you may appreciate already, many lawyers simply could not represent their clients effectively or perform other work responsibilities without the assistance of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page214" class="pagebreak">214</span>these professionals. Yet, unlike other lawyers whom you may supervise or manage, non-lawyer assistants are not subject to the Rules of Professional Conduct. Rule 5.3 thus codifies when a lawyer will be subject to discipline if a non-lawyer assistant engages in conduct that is &#x201C;incompatible&#x201D; with the lawyer&#x2019;s professional responsibilities.</p>
<h3 class="secmain" id="r1-19"><span class="bold">The Rule</span></h3>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 5.3 is divided into three subsections that should remind you of the structure and content of Rule 5.1 Subsection (a) identifies a supervisory lawyer&#x2019;s broader responsibility for maintaining an ethical law practice that employs non-lawyer assistants. Subsection (b) addresses a supervisory lawyer&#x2019;s responsibilities when directly supervising a non-lawyer assistant. And, subsection (c) establishes a type of vicarious liability for a supervisory lawyer for the conduct of a non-lawyer assistant when the supervisory lawyer orders, ratifies, or fails to remedy the assistant&#x2019;s misconduct.</p>
<div class="blue">

<p class="box_h"><span class="bold">Responsibility of Partners, Managers, and Supervisory Lawyers</span></p>
<p class="box-noindent">With respect to a nonlawyer employed or retained or associated with a lawyer:</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(a)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;a partner in a law firm, and a lawyer who individually or together with other lawyers possesses comparable managerial authority in a law firm, shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that the person&#x2019;s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer;</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(b)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;A lawyer having direct supervisory responsibility over another lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the person&#x2019;s conduct is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer; and</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(c)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;A lawyer shall be responsible for the conduct of such person that would be a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct if engaged in by a lawyer if:</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(1)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The lawyer orders or, with knowledge of the specific conduct, ratifies the conduct involved; or</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page215" class="pagebreak">215</div>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(2)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;the lawyer is a partner or has comparable managerial authority in the law firm in which the person is employed, or has direct supervisory authority over the person, and knows of the conduct at a time when its consequences can be avoided or mitigated but fails to take reasonable remedial action.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 5.3 modifies the language found in Rule 5.1 to reflect the fact that the non-lawyer assistant does not owe the professional responsibilities that a lawyer owes. Thus, the Rule directs the lawyer who manages, supervises, or directs a non-lawyer assistant reasonably to assure that the non-lawyer assistant&#x2019;s conduct is &#x201C;compatible&#x201D; with the lawyer&#x2019;s professional obligations. For example, &#x201C;[a] lawyer must give such assistants appropriate instruction and supervision concerning the ethical aspects of their employment, particularly regarding the obligation not to disclose information relating to the representation of the client.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_1" id="fn-1">1</a></sup></span> The assistants&#x2019; training, instruction, and supervision, moreover, &#x201C;should take account of the fact that they do not have legal training and are not subject to discipline.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_2" id="fn-2">2</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Similarly to Rule 5.1(c), Rule 5.3(c) can make a lawyer personally responsible for the conduct of a non-lawyer assistant&#x2014;in this context, when the assistant&#x2019;s conduct would violate the Rules if the lawyer had engaged in that conduct. A lawyer will be vicariously liable and subject to discipline for this conduct by a non-lawyer assistant in two circumstances: if the lawyer ordered or knowingly ratified that conduct or if the lawyer was a manager or partner in the firm or directly supervised the non-lawyer assistant and knowingly failed to avoid or mitigate the consequences of the assistant&#x2019;s conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent1">This Rule further identifies some special considerations that a lawyer should consider when outsourcing work to non-lawyer assistants. This outsourced work can include independent contractor investigator or expert services, document production or review, commercial cellular, email, cloud services, or any other non-lawyer services that the lawyer employs. Many lawyers easily may take these services for granted without managing them as outsourced non-lawyer assistance under Rule 5.3. Whenever a lawyer outsources these non-lawyer services, the Rule counsels:</p>
<p class="blockquote">[A] lawyer must make reasonable efforts to ensure that the services are provided in a manner that is compatible with the lawyer&#x2019;s professional obligations. The extent of this obligation will depend on the circumstances, including the education, experience and reputation of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page216" class="pagebreak">216</span>the non-lawyer; the nature of the services involved; the terms of any arrangements concerning the protection of client information; and the legal and ethical environments of the jurisdictions in which the services will be performed, particularly with regard to confidentiality.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_3" id="fn-3">3</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">These considerations often will cause this Rule to interact naturally with many other Rules, including: Rule 1.6 and confidentiality; Rule 1.1 and competence; Rule 5.4 and a lawyer&#x2019;s professional independence; and Rule 5.5 and unauthorized practice of law.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_4" id="fn-4">4</a></sup></span> These considerations also implicate issues concerning the allocation of monitoring responsibility between the lawyer and client, especially if the client requests a particular service provider.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_5" id="fn-5">5</a></sup></span> Rule 5.3 requires a lawyer to engage and resolve these issues actively to ensure that non-lawyer assistance remains compatible with the lawyer&#x2019;s professional obligations.</p>
<p class="noindent">Assess whether this lawyer complied with Rule 5.3:</p>
<p class="image-exeL"><img src="../Casebook/images/exe.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="example"><span class="bolda">Example.</span> Lawyer Annika ran a busy legal aid office. Underfunded and under-resourced, lawyers in the office struggled to communicate in a timely manner with clients and third parties on top of everything else the lawyers needed to handle. Unable to employ more lawyers, Annika decided to employ a dedicated team of legal assistants to communicate with clients and third persons. The assistants would handle the bulk of these communications on behalf of the office&#x2019;s lawyers, freeing lawyers to work on other tasks. The assistants would be trained and supervised by lawyers in the office who would create checklists for the assistants to follow. The assistants would interview all clients, locate and interview witnesses, respond to inquiries about client matters, attend hearings, trials, depositions, and other proceedings, and conduct research and draft correspondence and other documents. The assistants would be instructed to identify themselves as non-lawyer assistants. The assistant also would be directed to document all information carefully for lawyer review and would brief lawyers on client matters at regular intervals.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_6" id="fn-6">6</a></sup></span> May Annika employ these legal assistants consistent with Rule 5.3?</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page217" class="pagebreak">217</div>
<div class="ana">
<p class="analysis"><span class="bolda">Analysis.</span> Annika may risk violating Rule 5.3 in delegating this kind and degree of work to non-lawyer assistants. Generally, a lawyer may direct a non-lawyer to communicate with the client to gather information or to deliver advice from the lawyer.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_7" id="fn-7">7</a></sup></span> The non-lawyer assistant also may be tasked with communicating with third persons on behalf of the lawyer.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_8" id="fn-8">8</a></sup></span> The non-lawyer assistant&#x2019;s role, however, &#x201C;may not go beyond this [function] to involve the exercise of legal judgment, for example, by expanding the lawyer&#x2019;s advice or providing legal advice beyond [the advice] provided by the lawyer&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_9" id="fn-9">9</a></sup></span> or in judging what confidential information should be disclosed to a third person. The non-lawyer assistant instead must remain a conduit of information between the lawyer and client or third persons, where the lawyer retains the ability and authority to exercise all legal judgment.</p>
<p class="noindent1">As a result, the proper extent of these communications will be a question for the lawyer&#x2019;s professional judgment. The lawyer, however, must appropriately train, supervise, and limit the assistants consistent with both Rule 5.3 and the lawyer&#x2019;s other professional obligations.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_10" id="fn-10">10</a></sup></span> Annika&#x2019;s supervision plan does manage the assistants&#x2019; work effectively in many respects. Yet, because of &#x201C;the reliance on nonlawyer assistants as the exclusive communication link in some matters and situations, the risk of the lawyer&#x2019;s failure to meet professional obligations is so increased that the practice should be carefully and astutely managed.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_11" id="fn-11">11</a></sup></span></p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">Consider this additional example:</p>
<p class="image-exeL"><img src="../Casebook/images/exe.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="example"><span class="bolda">Example.</span> Lawyer Washington practiced plaintiff&#x2019;s personal injury law as a solo practitioner. Washington retained a client in a potentially big contingent fee case in which the client was seriously injured during a multi-vehicle accident. Washington hired private investigator Epstein. Washington had not worked with Epstein previously, but Epstein was famous for being able to get the witness statements that no other investigator could obtain. Washington expected some of the witnesses in this case to be tough to locate and interview. When Washington met with Epstein, Epstein claimed he would be able to get the witness statements that Washington needed. Washington asked, &#x201C;How do you do it?&#x201D; Epstein replied, &#x201C;Look, I spent <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page218" class="pagebreak">218</span>twenty years as a police detective. I was trained in the art of deception and leverage in obtaining suspect and witness statements. Plus, most people still assume I&#x2019;m a detective when I talk with them, and I don&#x2019;t disabuse them of that idea if it will make them feel more obliged to talk. Even if they are uneasy about their statement, I get them to sign it right there to lock them into it. But hey, you shouldn&#x2019;t worry about how the sausage is made, so long as I bring you what you need.&#x201D; Should Washington work with Epstein?</p>
<div class="ana">
<p class="analysis"><span class="bolda">Analysis.</span> Washington should reach a very clear meeting of the minds with Epstein before employing Epstein. Washington personally could not employ deception or undue &#x201C;leverage&#x201D; when interviewing witnesses,<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_12" id="fn-12">12</a></sup></span> nor could Washington exploit a witness&#x2019; misunderstanding about Washington&#x2019;s identity and role as his client&#x2019;s lawyer.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_13" id="fn-13">13</a></sup></span> Washington could no more engage in this conduct through his investigator that he could engage in it himself&#x2014;even if that conduct was entirely appropriate for Epstein as a detective or an investigator.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_14" id="fn-14">14</a></sup></span> If Washington failed to supervise Epstein reasonably to ensure that Epstein interviewed witnesses in a manner that was compatible with Washington&#x2019;s professional obligations, Washington would be subject to discipline under Rule 5.3(b). Moreover, if Washington simply employed Epstein having the information that Washington learned about Epstein&#x2019;s investigation practices, Washington personally could be responsible for Epstein&#x2019;s conduct, either because Washington implicitly ratified that conduct<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_15" id="fn-15">15</a></sup></span> or because he failed to take remedial action to avoid it.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_16" id="fn-16">16</a></sup></span></p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">Instead, Washington should make clear to Epstein the restraints on witness interview practices that would be compatible with Washington&#x2019;s own professional obligations, and ensure with Epstein that he will honor those restraints. If Epstein cannot follow these restraints on his investigative practices, Washington should work with another investigator.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Accordingly, Rule 5.3 empowers lawyers to employ and work with a wide range of non-lawyer assistants. These non-lawyer assistants can be invaluable in helping the lawyer to provide competent and diligent representation. But, lawyers still have a professional responsibility of reasonably assuring that non-lawyer assistants <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page219" class="pagebreak">219</span>are sufficiently well trained, supervised, and limited in their duties, so that all assistants&#x2019; conduct is compatible with the lawyer&#x2019;s own professional obligations.</p>

<p class="noindent1">When working with a non-lawyer assistant, a lawyer must supervise the assistant reasonably to ensure that an assistant&#x2019;s conduct is compatible with the lawyer&#x2019;s professional obligations. A supervisory lawyer will be personally responsible for the assistant&#x2019;s conduct that would violate the Rules of Professional Conduct if the lawyer engaged in it if the lawyer ordered or knowingly ratified that conduct, or knowingly failed to avoid or mitigate the consequences of that conduct.</p>
