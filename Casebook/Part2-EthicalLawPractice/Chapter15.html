<h3 class="secmain" id="int1-15"><span class="bold">Introduction</span></h3>
<p class="image-lensL"><img src="images/ltt.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="noindent1"><span class="bold">&#x201C;</span>Free consultation!&#x201D; You likely have heard this offer as part of a lawyer&#x2019;s advertising scheme. This offer to &#x201C;consult&#x201D; reflects the fact that a lawyer often does not go from zero-to-sixty when forming a client-lawyer relationship. On the contrary, a lawyer needs to be careful about forming a client-lawyer relationship. Before accepting a client, a lawyer needs to screen for whether he or she is competent to handle the matter,<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_1" id="fn-1">1</a></sup></span> can handle it diligently,<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_2" id="fn-2">2</a></sup></span> and has any conflicts of interest that prevent the lawyer from representing the client.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_3" id="fn-3">3</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="clear"></p>
<p class="noindent1">A &#x201C;prospective client&#x201D; under Rule 1.18 provides this opportunity to screen a case without committing to a lawyer-client relationship. Therefore, the prospective client is not a random person off the street, but also not quite yet a client. Lawyers, however, should be cautious about forming this consultative relationship, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page154" class="pagebreak">154</span>because, as Rule 1.18 makes clear, a lawyer owes professional responsibilities even to a prospective client. The responsibility owed to a prospective client does not amount to the full professional responsibilities that a lawyer owes to a client. But prospective client responsibilities are important because of their professional and business consequences.</p>
<h3 class="secmain" id="r1-13"><span class="bold">The Rule</span></h3>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 1.18 has four subsections. The first subsection defines a prospective client. Subsections (b) and (c) identify the professional responsibilities a lawyer owes to a prospective client. Subsection (d) provides for exceptions to the disqualification rule that otherwise can apply once a lawyer has consulted with a prospective client.</p>
<h4 class="secsub" id="s2-39"><span class="bold">1.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Prospective Client</span></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 1.18(a) defines a prospective client:</p>
<div class="blue">
<h3 class="sectiona" id="rs1-30"><img src="images/p154.jpg" alt="Image" /></h3>
<p class="box_h"><span class="bold">Duties to Prospective Clients</span></p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(a)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;<u>A person who consults with a lawyer about the possibility of forming a client-lawyer relationship</u> with respect to a matter is a prospective client.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">This Rule defines who has crossed the important line for a lawyer from stranger to a professional relationship. A prospective client importantly is not the lawyer&#x2019;s client. On the contrary, the lawyer consults with a prospective client to determine <span class="italic">whether</span> to accept the person as a client&#x2014;and correspondingly, for the prospective client to decide whether to hire the lawyer. Accordingly, &#x201C;a lawyer&#x2019;s consultations with a prospective client usually are limited in time and depth and leave both the prospective client and the lawyer free (and sometimes required) to proceed no further.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_4" id="fn-4">4</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">The consultation about forming a client-lawyer relationship is the defining event for identifying whether someone has become a prospective client.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_5" id="fn-5">5</a></sup></span> Whether <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page155" class="pagebreak">155</span>particular communications constitute a consultation will depend on the circumstances.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_6" id="fn-6">6</a></sup></span> But, the comments offer some concrete examples:</p>
<p class="blockquote">[A] consultation is likely to have occurred if a lawyer, either in person or through the lawyer&#x2019;s advertising in any medium, specifically requests or invites the submission of information about a potential representation without clear and reasonably understandable warnings and cautionary statements that limit the lawyer&#x2019;s obligations, and a person provides information in response &#x2026; . In contrast, a consultation does not occur if a person provides information to a lawyer in response to advertising that merely describes the lawyer&#x2019;s education, experience, areas of practice, and contact information, or provides legal information of general interest. Such a person communicates unilaterally to a lawyer, without any reasonable expectation that the lawyer is willing to discuss the possibility of forming a client-lawyer relationship, and thus is not a &#x201C;prospective client.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_7" id="fn-7">7</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Therefore, a lawyer must be deliberate when advertising, either to limit the content of that advertising or to include objectively clear disclaimers that the lawyer is not necessarily willing to consult with any person who responds to the advertisement. Either way, an objective test prevails for whether a lawyer has a prospective client relationship with someone: whether that person reasonably expects that the lawyer will be willing to discuss forming a client-lawyer relationship.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_8" id="fn-8">8</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent">Evaluate whether this lawyer formed a prospective client relationship:</p>
<p class="image-exeL"><img src="images/exe.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="example"><span class="bolda">Example.</span> Lawyer Dealio contracted with a daily deal advertising service to email subscribers with an advertisement from Dealio: if 25 people purchased will-preparation services from Dealio, he would prepare a standard will for $250. If someone purchased this daily deal from Dealio, would he or she be a prospective client?</p>
<div class="ana">
<p class="analysis"><span class="bolda">Analysis.</span> This kind of daily deal service, such as Groupon, raises a number of ethical issues, because the lawyer has not consulted with the people to whom the lawyer has offered his or her legal services at an advertised price. In a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page156" class="pagebreak">156</span>recent opinion, the American Bar Association concluded that &#x201C;mere purchase of a deal for legal services does not make the buyer either a prospective client or a current client, entitled to the attendant duties owed by the lawyer.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_9" id="fn-9">9</a></sup></span> Nevertheless, because of the potential for misunderstanding by daily deal purchasers, the opinion advised lawyers to be very clear about the possible limitations on the lawyer&#x2019;s ability to represent every purchaser. The opinion further counseled lawyers to include information about whether the advertised services could be transferred, for instance, if the purchaser gave the deal to a third party as a gift.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="secsub" id="s2-40"><span class="bold">2.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Confidentiality</span></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 1.18(b) identifies one of the professional responsibilities a lawyer owes to a prospective client:</p>
<div class="blue">
<h3 class="sectiona" id="rs1-31"><img src="images/p156.jpg" alt="Image" /></h3>
<p class="box_h"><span class="bold">Duties to Prospective Clients</span></p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(b)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Even when no client-lawyer relationship ensues, a lawyer who has learned information from a prospective client shall not use or reveal that information, except as Rule 1.9 would permit with respect to information of a former client.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">To consult effectively with a lawyer about the nature of legal services sought and any limitations to the lawyer&#x2019;s representation, a prospective client often must reveal sensitive information to the lawyer. Regardless of whether the lawyer ultimately represents the prospective client or how brief the consultation may have been, the lawyer must treat the information learned during the consultation as confidential.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_10" id="fn-10">10</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Confidential information includes more than privileged information, or information that would be harmful or embarrassing to the prospective client. Rather, the definition of confidential information in the Rules of Professional Conduct includes &#x201C;<span class="italic">any</span> information relating to the [consultation].&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_11" id="fn-11">11</a></sup></span> For purposes of confidentiality, Rule 1.18 requires a lawyer to treat a former prospective client as a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page157" class="pagebreak">157</span>former client under Rule 1.9. Under Rule 1.9(c), a lawyer may not use information relating to the representation of a former client to the disadvantage of that client or reveal that information without informed consent or other authority. A lawyer therefore must be very careful with prospective client information, even when no client relationship results from the consultation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Did this lawyer adhere to the duty of confidentiality with his prospective client?</p>
<p class="image-exeL"><img src="images/exe.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="example"><span class="bolda">Example.</span> Lawyer Celebro was contacted by Starlet. Starlet wanted to consult with Celebro about the possibly of Celebro representing Starlet. Starlet had been an A-list celebrity until she began to have significant personal problems relating to drug and alcohol abuse and potential mental health issues. Starlet ultimately was convicted of drunk driving and placed on probation. Starlet struggled on probation and ultimately was charged with violating probation for failing drug tests, leaving the state without permission, and being arrested for yet another offense. Starlet had alienated her previous lawyer, so she was in the market, and Celebro was an experienced lawyer at representing celebrity clients. After consulting with Starlet, however, Celebro declined to represent her. The media learned of the consultation and contacted Celebro for a statement. Celebro did not want anyone to think that Starlet had rejected him, so he made clear that he declined to represent her, and gave reasons like, &#x201C;She is in a dangerous state, and does not appear to understand the gravity and urgency of her situation,&#x201D; and &#x201C;she refused to consider leaving Hollywood, which is toxic for her,&#x201D; and &#x201C;she&#x2019;s a fragile, lost child&#x2014;a sleeping beauty with her head in the sand.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_12" id="fn-12">12</a></sup></span> Did Celebro follow Rule 1.18(b)?</p>
<div class="ana">
<p class="analysis"><span class="bolda">Analysis.</span> Celebro consulted with Starlet as a prospective client. Thus, even though Celebro did not ultimately represent Starlet, Celebro owed a duty of confidentiality to Starlet regarding information learned during the consultation. Starlet&#x2019;s statements and her demeanor during the consultation constituted information relating to the consultation. Indeed, Celebro&#x2019;s disclosures plausibly could prejudice Starlet, who was on probation and facing a probation violation. As applied by Rule 1.18(b), Rule 1.9(c) provides that a lawyer shall not reveal this information, absent informed consent or other authority. Accordingly, unless Starlet consented to Celebro&#x2019;s disclosures, or Celebro had some other authority to disclose this information without Starlet&#x2019;s consent, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page158" class="pagebreak">158</span>Celebro&#x2019;s disclosures to the media revealed confidential information from a prospective client consultation.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="secsub" id="s2-41"><span class="bold">3.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Conflicts of Interest</span></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 1.18 recognizes a duty of conflict-free consultation with prospective clients:</p>
<div class="blue">
<h3 class="sectiona" id="rs1-32"><img src="images/p156.jpg" alt="Image" /></h3>
<p class="box_h"><span class="bold">Duties to Prospective Clients</span></p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(c)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;A lawyer subject to paragraph (b) shall not represent a client with interests materially adverse to those of a prospective client in the same or a substantially related matter if the client received information from the prospective client that could be significantly harmful to that person in the matter, except as provided in paragraph (d). If a lawyer is disqualified from representation under this paragraph, no lawyer in a firm with which the lawyer is associated may knowingly undertake or continue representation in such matter, except as provided in paragraph (d).</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(d)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;When a lawyer has received disqualifying information as defined in paragraph (c), the representation is permissible if:</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(1)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;both the affected client and the prospective client have given informed consent, confirmed in writing, or:</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(2)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;the lawyer who received the information took reasonable measures to avoid exposure to more disqualifying information than was reasonably necessary to determine whether to represent the prospective client; and</p>
<p class="list-roman">i.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;the disqualified lawyer is timely screened from any participation in the matter and is apportioned no part of the fee therefrom; and</p>
<p class="list-roman">ii.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;written notice is promptly given to the prospective client.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">A lawyer owes both a duty of confidentiality and a duty of loyalty to prospective clients.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_13" id="fn-13">13</a></sup></span> Consequently, similar to a lawyer&#x2019;s duty to a former client, a lawyer may <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page159" class="pagebreak">159</span>not represent a prospective client who has materially adverse interests to a current client in the same or a substantially related matter. Thus, good reason to be careful about inviting a prospective client consultation: the lawyer can be disqualified from subsequent business opportunities through consultations with prospective clients. Rule 1.18 does not define material adversity or the same or a substantially related matter, which limit the disqualification rule. But these terms are identical to the terms used in Rule 1.9 relating to former clients.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_14" id="fn-14">14</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">A lawyer, however, more easily can avoid this disqualification rule with prospective clients than with former clients. First, the prospective client disqualification applies only if the lawyer received information that could be significantly harmful to the prospective client in the matter. A lawyer therefore may limit the consultation to information only reasonably necessary to avoid learning disqualifying information.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_15" id="fn-15">15</a></sup></span> Second, &#x201C;a lawyer may condition a consultation with a prospective client on the person&#x2019;s informed consent that no information disclosed during the consultation will prohibit the lawyer from representing a different client in the matter.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_16" id="fn-16">16</a></sup></span> Finally, under Rule 1.18(d)(2), a disqualified lawyer can relieve her or his law firm from imputed disqualification by timely screening the lawyer from the current client&#x2019;s case.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_17" id="fn-17">17</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Outside of these circumstances, however, a lawyer&#x2019;s consultation with a prospective client can disqualify the lawyer from subsequent representation of another client in the same or a substantially related matter.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_18" id="fn-18">18</a></sup></span> This disqualification, moreover, will include the lawyer&#x2019;s entire law firm, unless the disqualified lawyer is timely screened. Accordingly, lawyers should heed the duties owed to prospective clients and screen them with good judgment prior to any consultation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 1.18 therefore provides lawyers with the important opportunity to screen clients before they become clients. But when a lawyer consults with a prospective client, the lawyer owes that person duties of confidentiality and conflict-free consultation. A lawyer thus should be careful about creating a prospective client relationship to ensure the lawyer can manage these duties, particularly with respect to other clients.</p>

<p class="quick" id="qs1-15"><span class="bold">Quick Summary</span></p>
<p class="fold-L1"><img src="images/fold1.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="noindent1">Under <span class="bold">Rule 1.18,</span> a prospective client is a person who consults with a lawyer about forming a client-lawyer relationship. The lawyer owes the prospective client duties of confidentiality and conflict-free consultation. The lawyer, however, may cabin the consultation or screen him or herself in future cases to limit this disqualification rule.</p>
