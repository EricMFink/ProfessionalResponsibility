<h3 class="secmain" id="int1-17"><span class="bold">Introduction</span></h3>
<p class="image-lensL"><img src="images/ltt.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="noindent1">Money can be both the bounty and the bane of a law practice. As one experienced lawyer has observed, &#x201C;[i]n the life of a law firm, fees and principles often collide.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_1" id="fn-1">1</a></sup></span> Many court decisions, for instance, historically have recited the proposition that &#x201C;the profession is a branch of the administration of justice and not a mere money-getting trade.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_2" id="fn-2">2</a></sup></span> This principle prioritizes the practice of law as a profession, rather than as a business.</p>
<p class="clear"></p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page172" class="pagebreak">172</div>
<p class="noindent1">Yet, the Rules of Professional Conduct recognize that a lawyer has every right to &#x201C;earn[] a satisfactory living.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_3" id="fn-3">3</a></sup></span> The Rules of Professional Conduct thus acknowledge that the practice of law, to some extent, is a business for lawyers. &#x201C;But let&#x2019;s not pretend,&#x201D; the already noted lawyer professed, &#x201C;The evidence is that lawyers, by and large, operate money-getting endeavors. The public believes that we are venal and charge too much.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_4" id="fn-4">4</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">So what is the practice of law? A profession to administer justice, or a money-getting business? The answer is &#x201C;both.&#x201D; Individual lawyers operate at many different points along a profession-business spectrum. Some lawyers commit their careers to public service as prosecutors, public defenders, legal services lawyers, and other public interest vocations, often at below-market rates of remuneration. Other lawyers, by contrast, practice in very profit-conscious private market environments, such as the classic big law firms, tech-industry law practices, and &#x201C;boutique&#x201D; law practices. And yet, other lawyers work in a middle ground, practicing in private practice in one form or another, but maybe in solo, small firm, or small community practices. Other points on this practice spectrum abound.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The law largely accommodates this broad spectrum of law practice priorities. Rule 1.5, however, does regulate an exceedingly important aspect of this professionbusiness dynamic: the fees that a lawyer may charge a client. Fees became an ethical issue, not surprisingly, because lawyers&#x2019; conduct made fees an ethical issue.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_5" id="fn-5">5</a></sup></span> Indeed, as one State Bar Counsel article observed, &#x201C;[l]awyer&#x2019;s fees are a frequent cause for complaint to the Office of Bar Counsel.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_6" id="fn-6">6</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">You should identify some important ethical precepts from your review of Rule 1.5: Lawyers have discretion in the fees they may charge. The standard, however, is not whatever the market will bear, rather a lawyer may charge only a reasonable fee. Lawyers also have a duty of fee transparency with clients. But, the required disclosures will differ depending on the nature or basis of the fee agreement. Some fee agreements, even if otherwise efficient, are nevertheless prohibited because they risk too much interference with a lawyer&#x2019;s independent professional judgment.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page173" class="pagebreak">173</div>
<p class="noindent1">But first, some fee terminology. When working through Rule 1.5, you should know what some common fee-related terms generally mean: &#x201C;retainer,&#x201D; &#x201C;billable hour,&#x201D; &#x201C;flat fee,&#x201D; and &#x201C;contingent fee.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="noindent1">A &#x201C;retainer&#x201D; can have many meanings for lawyers. &#x201C;Retainer&#x201D; colloquially can simply identify the act of hiring a lawyer&#x2014;&#x201C;the client retained the lawyer&#x201D;&#x2014;without referring to a specific kind of fee agreement. A &#x201C;retainer&#x201D; also can mean a type of fee advance&#x2014;an amount of money the client gives the lawyer to hold, with the expectation that the lawyer will earn that money consistent with the fee agreement.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_7" id="fn-7">7</a></sup></span> Another use of &#x201C;retainer&#x201D; refers to an availability, or &#x201C;true,&#x201D; retainer, meaning &#x201C;a fee that a client pays to a lawyer to be available to the client during a specified period or on a specified matter, in addition to and apart from any compensation for legal services performed.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_8" id="fn-8">8</a></sup></span> You therefore will need to judge the meaning of &#x201C;retainer&#x201D; from its context.</p>
<p class="noindent1">&#x201C;Billable hour&#x201D; denotes a fee where the lawyer is paid for time expended, not by project or outcome. The billable hour has generated volumes of critical commentary, largely because of the incentives pay-for-time billing creates for lawyers to work inefficiently and in extreme volume,<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_9" id="fn-9">9</a></sup></span> as well as to engage in over-billing practices.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_10" id="fn-10">10</a></sup></span> But the billable hour nevertheless remains a feature of many lawyers&#x2019; billing practices.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_11" id="fn-11">11</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">A &#x201C;flat fee,&#x201D; by contrast, refers to project rather than time-based billing. One state, for example, has defined a flat fee to mean, &#x201C;[a] lawyer may charge a flat fee for specified legal services, which constitutes complete payment for those services and is paid in whole or in part in advance of the lawyer providing the services.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_12" id="fn-12">12</a></sup></span> A <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page174" class="pagebreak">174</span>flat fee necessarily incentivizes more efficient work by the lawyer to complete the designated project. Yet, the lawyer and the client also assume some additional risk that the project may prove more or less costly than anticipated.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_13" id="fn-13">13</a></sup></span> Generally, the billable hour presents less risk of unanticipated project costs or savings.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Finally, a &#x201C;contingent fee&#x201D; refers to a fee where the client&#x2019;s payment to the lawyer is contingent on a particular outcome: a damages award, for instance, or an amount of costs saved. This fee agreement is the basis for the common &#x201C;no fee unless you win!&#x201D; lawyer advertising you may have seen on the internet or on daytime television. The contingent fee remains controversial because of the incentive it can create for lawyers to litigate and to litigate to specific outcomes.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_14" id="fn-14">14</a></sup></span> But, the contingent fee also has been viewed as an important means for persons with valid claims but few resources to access representation.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_15" id="fn-15">15</a></sup></span> Either way, the contingent fee carries greater risk of no payment or under-payment to the lawyer, or from the client&#x2019;s perspective, of a windfall lawyer&#x2019;s fee.</p>
<p class="noindent1">With this introduction to lawyer fees in mind, consider how Rule 1.5 regulates fees generally, and also in specific contexts.</p>
<h3 class="secmain" id="r1-15"><span class="bold">The Rule</span></h3>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 1.5 has five subsections. Subsection (a) restricts lawyers to charging a reasonable fee. Subsection (b) identifies the necessary disclosures for an ethical fee agreement. Subsection (c) adds to these necessary disclosures in cases where the lawyer charges a contingent fee. Subsection (d), in turn, identifies circumstances where a contingent fee is prohibited. Finally, subsection (e) governs fees divided between lawyers who are not in the same law firm.</p>
<h4 class="secsub" id="s2-46"><span class="bold">1.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Reasonable Fees</span></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 1.5(a) prohibits unreasonable fees, and identifies relevant factors for determining whether a fee is substantively reasonable. Relatedly, Rule 1.5(b) dictates the necessary transparency required of a fee agreement for the client to understand the fee&#x2019;s reasonableness:</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page175" class="pagebreak">175</div>
<div class="blue">
<h3 class="sectiona" id="rs1-37"><img src="images/p175.jpg" alt="Image" /></h3>
<p class="box_h"><span class="bold">Fees</span></p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(a)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;A lawyer shall not make an agreement for, charge, or collect an unreasonable fee or an unreasonable amount for expenses. The factors to be considered in determining the reasonableness of a fee include the following:</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(1)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill required to perform the legal service properly;</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(2)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;the likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the acceptance of the employment will preclude other employment by the lawyer;</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(3)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services;</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(4)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;the amount involved and the results obtained;</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(5)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;the time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances;</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(6)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client;</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(7)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services; and</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(8)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;whether the fee is fixed or contingent.</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(b)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The scope of representation and the basis or rate of the fee and expenses for which the client will be responsible shall be communicated to the client, preferably in writing, before or within a reasonable time after commencing the representation, except when the lawyer will charge a regularly represented client on the same basis or rate. Any changes in the basis or rate of the fee or expenses shall also be communicated to the client.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 1.5(a) limits a lawyer to charging a reasonable fee, as well as reasonable expenses. This limitation is grounded in &#x201C;the notion that the attorney-client relationship is not necessarily one of equals, that it is built on trust, and that the client is encouraged to be dependent on the lawyer, who is dealing with matters of great <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page176" class="pagebreak">176</span>moment to the client.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_16" id="fn-16">16</a></sup></span> The Rule is not designed to leave lawyers underpaid, but rather to maintain a balance of interests. Excessive fees could &#x201C;deter [laypersons] from utilizing the legal system in protection of their rights.&#x2019; &#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_17" id="fn-17">17</a></sup></span> At the same time, &#x201C; &#x2018;adequate compensation is necessary in order to enable the lawyer to serve his [or her] client effectively and to preserve the integrity and independence of the profession.&#x2019; &#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_18" id="fn-18">18</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">As Rule 1.5(a) suggests, a fee&#x2019;s reasonableness requires a holistic assessment of the fee. Thus, the reasonableness criteria in subsection (a) provide a lawyer with a lot of flexibility in determining a reasonable fee. Still, a lawyer must base a client&#x2019;s fee on the criteria, because they ethically guide and limit any fee that the lawyer may set. A fee&#x2019;s reasonableness is also judged not solely on billing increments, such as an hourly rate, but also on the total fee charged.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_19" id="fn-19">19</a></sup></span> In the end, perhaps the key reasonableness question is whether the lawyer earned the fee that the lawyer has claimed, consistent with the criteria identified in Rule 1.5(a).<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_20" id="fn-20">20</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Subsection (b) adds a transparency requirement to this reasonableness assessment: the lawyer must adequately communicate &#x201C;[t]he scope of representation and the basis or rate of the fee and expenses for which the client will be responsible.&#x201D; This disclosure permits the client to judge how and whether the lawyer has earned the fee consistent with the fee agreement. According to the Rule, the lawyer must disclose this information &#x201C;before or within a reasonable time after commencing the representation.&#x201D; An American Bar Association opinion, however, makes clear that this disclosure duty is a &#x201C;two-fold duty, including not only an explanation at the beginning of engagement of the basis on which fees and other charges will be billed, but also a sufficient explanation in the [ultimate billing] statement so that the client may reasonably be expected to understand what fees and charges the client is actually being billed.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_21" id="fn-21">21</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Consider how the Rule links the basis or rate of the fee to the scope of representation. A client cannot be expected to appreciate the basis or rate of the fee, and whether the lawyer has earned the fee, without a clear understanding of the expected <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page177" class="pagebreak">177</span>scope of representation. Note also that this Rule prefers a written fee agreement, but does not require one. Best practice of course would be to use written fee agreements regularly, because &#x201C;[a] written statement concerning the terms of the engagement reduces the possibility of misunderstanding.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_22" id="fn-22">22</a></sup></span> The Rule recognizes, however, that &#x201C;[w]hen the lawyer has regularly represented a client, they ordinarily will have evolved an understanding concerning the basis or rate of the fee for which the client will be responsible.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_23" id="fn-23">23</a></sup></span> Less formality in these circumstances may be appropriate, if the lawyer otherwise can ensure clarity in the scope of representation and the fee and expenses.</p>
<p class="noindent">Consider whether this lawyer honored Rule 1.5(a):</p>
<p class="image-exeL"><img src="images/exe.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="example"><span class="bolda">Example.</span> Lawyer Frugal had two client matters pending, one case with Client A and another case with Client B. Frugal billed both clients $250 an hour, a reasonable rate for these legal services under all the circumstances. For Client A, Frugal needed to fly to another state&#x2014;a three-hour flight. Frugal billed Client A $750 for the travel time. During the flight, Frugal did not want to be inefficient, and he had no pressing work to perform for Client A, so Frugal worked on pending motions for Client B during the whole flight. Frugal also billed Client B $750 for the three-hour flight. Did Frugal violate Rule 1.5(a)?</p>
<div class="ana">
<p class="analysis"><span class="bolda">Analysis.</span> Frugal billed both clients solely on the basis of time. Frugal likely could bill Client A for travel time, under the theory that the travel for Client A created lost opportunity costs for Frugal: by traveling for Client A, Frugal was unavailable for other paying work.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_24" id="fn-24">24</a></sup></span> In this case, however, Frugal did work for another client during the travel time. May the lawyer profit from the efficiency of working simultaneously for both clients?</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page178" class="pagebreak">178</div>
<p class="noindent1">As an American Bar Association opinion has framed this issue, Frugal should ask not what the lawyer could force a client to pay to increase Frugal&#x2019;s efficiency, but rather what Frugal earned from each client during the three-hour flight.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_25" id="fn-25">25</a></sup></span> Whatever Frugal&#x2019;s efficiency during the flight, Frugal did not earn six hours of billable time during a three-hour flight. Rather, Frugal &#x201C;double-billed&#x201D; for a single time period, and double-billing is &#x201C;contrary to the mandate of the Model Rules.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_26" id="fn-26">26</a></sup></span> Frugal instead was &#x201C;obliged to pass the benefits of these economies to the client.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_27" id="fn-27">27</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">But which client? What options did Frugal have? Frugal could have billed only Client A for travel time. If Frugal had work to perform for Client A during the flight, all the more efficient, and only one client still is billed for this time. If Frugal did not have work to perform for Client A and did not want to take the flight without working, Frugal could have worked for Client B and instead have billed only Client B. Frugal would not have worked for Client A for free in this circumstance, because Frugal would not have earned anything from Client A. Frugal did not work for Client A during the fight. Moreover, if Frugal still was able to work for Client B during the flight, Frugal did not lose any employment opportunities because of the travel for Client A.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_28" id="fn-28">28</a></sup></span></p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">Evaluate this lawyer&#x2019;s charging of expenses:</p>
<p class="image-exeL"><img src="images/exe.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="example"><span class="bolda">Example.</span> Lawyer Pennywise represented Client Parsimonious in a large transactional matter. The case required high volumes of document management services over a long period of time. Because Pennywise worked regularly with her document management service, she received a discounted rate for this service, below the market rate. Pennywise nevertheless charged Parsimonious the market rate for these services, explaining to a partner, &#x201C;The client should pay market rates&#x2014;they didn&#x2019;t earn our discount, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page179" class="pagebreak">179</span>we did.&#x201D; Pennywise invoiced the service to Parsimonious as &#x201C;document review services&#x2014;standard rate.&#x201D; Did Pennywise violate Rule 1.5?</p>
<div class="ana">
<p class="analysis"><span class="bolda">Analysis.</span> Yes, Pennywise likely violated Rule 1.5. A lawyer typically should not bill a client for standard law office overhead, such as library maintenance, malpractice insurance, office rent, and utilities.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_29" id="fn-29">29</a></sup></span> Pennywise, however, billed Parsimonious for case-specific expenses. A lawyer may charge for reasonable expenses, and Pennywise charged Parsimonious market rates. But, lawyers generally may not profit from disbursements billed to the client as a case expense. For example, a lawyer generally may not add a surcharge to disbursements unless the lawyer in fact incurred that additional cost to the expense.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_30" id="fn-30">30</a></sup></span> Nor may a lawyer withhold an expense savings from the client to create a profit, as Pennywise did here. Otherwise, &#x201C;[c]lients quite properly could view these practices as an attempt to create additional profit centers when the client has been told he [or she] would be billed for disbursements.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_31" id="fn-31">31</a></sup></span></p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">Note that this practice implicates Rule 1.5(b), not just Rule 1.5(a), because Pennywise did not accurately communicate the &#x201C;rate of &#x2026; expenses.&#x201D; Indeed, Pennywise&#x2019;s invoice notation, &#x201C;standard rate,&#x201D; may have violated Rule 7.1, because this notation could have misled Parsimonious about the true cost of the document management service.</p>
<h4 class="secsub" id="s2-47"><span class="bold">2.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Contingent Fees</span></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 1.5(c) imposes special procedural requirements for contingent fees. Subsection (d) substantively limits the contingent fees to which a lawyer may agree:</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page180" class="pagebreak">180</div>
<div class="blue">
<h3 class="sectiona" id="rs1-38"><img src="images/p175.jpg" alt="Image" /></h3>
<p class="box_h"><span class="bold">Fees</span></p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(c)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;A fee may be contingent on the outcome of the matter for which the service is rendered, except in a matter in which a contingent fee is prohibited by paragraph (b) or other law. A contingent fee agreement shall be in a writing signed by the client and shall state the method by which the fee is to be determined, including the percentage or percentages that shall accrue to the lawyer in the event of settlement, trial or appeal; litigation and other expenses to be deducted from the recovery; and whether such expenses are to be deducted before or after the contingent fee is calculated. The agreement must clearly notify the client of any expenses for which the client will be liable whether or not the client is the prevailing party. Upon conclusion of the contingent fee matter, the lawyer shall provide the client with a written statement stating the outcome of the matter and, if there is a recovery, showing the remittance to the client and the method of its determination.</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(d)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;A lawyer shall not enter into an arrangement for, charge, or collect:</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(1)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Any fee in a domestic relations matter, the payment or amount of which is contingent upon securing a divorce or upon the amount of alimony or support, or property settlement in lieu thereof; or</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(2)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;A contingent fee for representing a defendant in a criminal case.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">Contingent fees have been subject to much historical debate, but Rule 1.5 generally permits contingent fees under certain conditions. Although often associated with personal injury practice, contingent fees are charged in a variety of contexts, such as collections matters, civil rights cases, securities and anti-trust actions, and other types of cases.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_32" id="fn-32">32</a></sup></span> Nor are contingent fees limited to plaintiffs&#x2019; work. For instance, a lawyer and a client may agree to a fee contingent on the amount of money a lawyer can save, such as by reducing or avoiding a damages award.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_33" id="fn-33">33</a></sup></span> Moreover, a contingent fee may be charged even if the client can afford another fee method and when a recovery was certain, and this fee method does not require counsel to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page181" class="pagebreak">181</span>seek an early settlement offer.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_34" id="fn-34">34</a></sup></span> A contingent fee also may increase based on how long the lawyer must litigate the case, such as settlement, trial, or appeal, and the fee further may increase with the amount of recovery.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_35" id="fn-35">35</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">The Rules of Professional Conduct, however, place three conditions on a valid contingent fee. First, the fee still must remain reasonable. Reasonableness in this context will account for the contingency, which often entails risk for the lawyer.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_36" id="fn-36">36</a></sup></span> The greater the risk of no- or under-recovery, the more likely a windfall fee will remain reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Second, Rule 1.5(c) requires greater disclosures by the lawyer to the client. Unlike other fee arrangements, a contingent fee agreement must be in a writing signed by the client.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_37" id="fn-37">37</a></sup></span> In addition, the written fee agreement must identify the controlling contingency or contingencies and how the fee will be based on that contingency. The written fee agreement further must notify the client of any expenses for which the client will remain liable regardless of outcome and must explain whether the lawyer&#x2019;s fee will be calculated before or after fees are deducted.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_38" id="fn-38">38</a></sup></span> And, at the conclusion of the matter, the lawyer must give the client a written statement identifying the outcome and the method of determining any recovery.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Third, contingent fees are prohibited in two classes of cases. Contingent fees are categorically prohibited in all criminal cases.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_39" id="fn-39">39</a></sup></span> Contingent fees also are prohibited in most domestic relations matters, where the contingency depends on the &#x201C;securing of a divorce or upon the amount of alimony or support, or property settlement in lieu thereof.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_40" id="fn-40">40</a></sup></span> What common domestic relations contingency can you identify is missing from this list? Note, moreover, that the domestic relation prohibition &#x201C;does not preclude a contract for a contingent fee for legal representation in connection with the recovery of post-judgment balances due under support, alimony <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page182" class="pagebreak">182</span>or other financial orders because such contracts do not implicate the same policy concerns.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_41" id="fn-41">41</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">But what are these policy concerns? The comments to Rule 1.5 do not explain the policy rationale for prohibiting contingent fees in all criminal cases and most domestic relations matters. Why do you think the Rule bans contingent fees in these cases, but permits them generally in all other matters?</p>
<p class="noindent">Evaluate the fee that this lawyer charged under Rule 1.5(d):</p>
<p class="image-exeL"><img src="images/exe.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="example"><span class="bolda">Example.</span> Lawyer Maximus practiced family law and specialized in highend divorces in a wealthy community. Maximus often charged as high as $600 an hour for his services. Maximus knew that because his wealthy clients had so much property and money on the line, they generally would be happy to pay more for a favorable case outcome. Maximus thus added to his standard divorce fee agreement a &#x201C;success bonus&#x201D; clause. This clause provided: &#x201C;In addition to the hourly fees described in this agreement, we may request an additional reasonable fee if the case outcome requires extraordinary difficulty, special expertise, or priority treatment over other clients. This additional charge is subject to your approval after discussion with you. The charge will not be imposed unless you agree to it.&#x201D; Does this fee improperly seek a contingent fee in a divorce case?</p>
<div class="ana">
<p class="analysis"><span class="bolda">Analysis.</span> At first blush, this fee functions quite like a contingent fee, which would be prohibited in a divorce case under Rule 1.5(d)(1). A divorce lawyer in a wealthy community recently used these &#x201C;success bonus&#x201D; clauses, and the State Bar considered whether the lawyer was subject to discipline. After a lengthy review, the State Disciplinary Counsel decided not to prosecute a violation of the contingent fee prohibition, because the voluntary nature of the bonus distinguished this fee from a true contingent fee.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_42" id="fn-42">42</a></sup></span> Do you agree with this decision?</p>

<h4 class="secsub" id="s2-48"><span class="bold">3.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Division of Fees</span></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 1.5(e) addresses circumstances where two or more lawyers, not from the same firm, wish to work on a case and divide the fee:</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page183" class="pagebreak">183</div>
<div class="blue">
<h3 class="sectiona" id="rs1-39"><img src="images/p175.jpg" alt="Image" /></h3>
<p class="box_h"><span class="bold">Fees</span></p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(e)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;A division of fees between lawyers who are not in the same firm may be made only if:</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(1)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;the client is advised in writing of and does not object to the participation of all the lawyers involved; and</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(2)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;the total fee is reasonable.</p>
<p class="box-noindent">Lawyers often collaborate on a client matter to pool expertise or resources, when &#x201C;neither one alone could serve the client as well.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_43" id="fn-43">43</a></sup></span> These lawyers of course will want to divide the client&#x2019;s fee. If the lawyers are in the same law firm, no special fee rule applies beyond the standard fee rules in Rule 1.5, because the lawyers in a firm are treated as a single professional unit for most ethical purposes.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_44" id="fn-44">44</a></sup></span> If, however, the lawyers who wish to divide the fee are not in the same firm, Rule 1.5(e) requires special procedures before the lawyers may divide a single fee.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">These fee arrangements are commonly used &#x201C;when the fee is contingent and the division is between a referring lawyer and a trial specialist.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_45" id="fn-45">45</a></sup></span> The immediate concern is that the fee &#x201C;division&#x201D; will be a prohibited referral fee by another name: &#x201C;I got the case, you work on it, and we will split the fee.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_46" id="fn-46">46</a></sup></span> Rule 1.5(e) does not address this concern explicitly, other than to require that the total fee remain reasonable. Other jurisdictions, however, provide that the lawyers who divide the fee may divide it only in one of two ways: (1) proportionate to the legal services actually performed by each lawyer; or (2) when each lawyer assumes joint responsibility for the representation.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_47" id="fn-47">47</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Under option (1), each lawyer has earned the fee by performing legal services, so the lawyers are not receiving a fee for a referral, but for work. Under option (2), by contrast, the lawyers ultimately may not divide the work proportionately to the work each lawyer performed. But, both lawyers have assumed &#x201C;financial and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page184" class="pagebreak">184</span>ethical responsibility for the representation as if the lawyers were associated in a partnership.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_48" id="fn-48">48</a></sup></span> Therefore, the lawyers may share the fee as lawyers in a single firm would share it. By contrast, a comment to the Delaware Rule provides that &#x201C;[p] aragraph (e) permits the lawyers to divide a fee without regard to whether the division is in proportion to services each lawyer renders or whether each lawyer assumes responsibility for the representation as a whole.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_49" id="fn-49">49</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Delaware Rule of Professional Conduct 1.5(e) does require that the client &#x201D;not object to the participation of all the lawyers involved.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_50" id="fn-50">50</a></sup></span> The lawyers also must advise the client of this arrangement in writing.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_51" id="fn-51">51</a></sup></span> The lawyers, however, must remember that if the fee involves a contingent fee, the fee agreement must still be in a writing signed by the client.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_52" id="fn-52">52</a></sup></span> And regardless of how the lawyers divide the fee, the total fee must remain reasonable under Rule 1.5(a).</p>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 1.5 accordingly guides lawyers, not in the complete business of law, but in the necessary ethical structures and limits to legal fees. The Rule is designed to help the lawyer to engage in better billing practices that should help to avoid many misunderstandings and fee disputes. Lawyers in private practice in particular must study this Rule closely to ensure both compliance with the Rules and effective billing practices.</p>
<div class="blue">
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(f)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;A lawyer may require the client to pay some sort or all of the fee in advance of the lawyer undertaking the representation, provided that:</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(1)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The lawyer shall provide the client with a written statement that the fee is refundable if it is not earned,</p>

<p class="fold-L1"><img src="images/fold1.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="noindent1"><span class="bold">Rule 1.5(a)</span> limits a lawyer to charging a reasonable fee, based on a number of criteria. Rule 1.5(b) requires the lawyer to disclose the scope of representation to the client, as well as the basis or rate of the fee, preferably in writing. Subsection (c) adds to these required disclosures when the lawyer charges a contingent fee, which must be in a writing signed by the client. Subsection (d) prohibits contingent fees in most domestic relations matters, and in all criminal cases. Rule 1.5(e) allows lawyers who are not in the same firm to divide a fee, but only if the client does not object and the total fee remains reasonable.</p>
