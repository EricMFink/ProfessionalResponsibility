<h3 class="secmain" id="int1-23"><span class="bold">Introduction</span></h3>
<p class="image-lensL"><img src="images/ltt.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="noindent1">Would you believe that it has only been recently that a lawyer could sell his or her law practice? Rule 1.17 allows a lawyer leaving the practice of law to sell his or her practice to another lawyer. Before the creation of this specific rule, however, many states did not permit a lawyer to sell his or her law practice. In fact, some states&#x2019; ethics rules specifically prohibited a lawyer from selling a law practice.</p>
<p class="clear"></p>
<p class="noindent1">For example, in 1945, the A.B.A. Committee on Professional Ethics and Grievances issued Opinion 266, which stated:</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page230" class="pagebreak">230</div>
<p class="blockquote">The purchase of the practice and good will of a deceased lawyer by another lawyer not his partner and the payment therefor [sic] to his estate measured by a percentage of the fees, gross or net, subsequently paid by his former clients, violates Canon 34, and may violate Canons 37 and 27.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_1" id="fn-1">1</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">As summarized by the Dean of Ethics, Henry Drinker, &#x201C;A lawyer&#x2019;s practice and good will may not be offered for sale.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_2" id="fn-2">2</a></sup></span> As the practice of law has evolved, so have the rules regarding the sale of a law practice.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In reality, the sale of a lawyer&#x2019;s practice happened rather frequently. First, it has always been the normal course of business for lawyers in a firm to buy out a partner, shareholder, or any of the other myriad ownership interests utilized by law firms. And through mergers and acquisitions, law firms managed to &#x201C;sell&#x201D; themselves to each other. Solo practitioners had to be more creative.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The physical fixtures and furnishings of the lawyer&#x2019;s office could be sold outright. Any amount paid beyond a reasonable fair market value for those items was subject to question as being improper.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_3" id="fn-3">3</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">For example, in 1976, the California appellate court reviewed an action between two California attorneys disputing payment under a 1970 contract for sale of a law office&#x2019;s physical assets, files, and work in progress.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_4" id="fn-4">4</a></sup></span> The selling lawyer agreed to sublet office space to the purchasing lawyer and to cooperate in sending appropriate ethical announcements. Moreover, the selling lawyer agreed not to practice within ten miles of the office or within six years from the date of the sale. The selling lawyer also expressed his intention to encourage present and former clients to utilize the legal services of the office in the future. The court in that case found that:</p>
<p class="blockquote">Although the contract &#x2026; is so drawn as to omit any reference to &#x201C;good will,&#x201D; precludes any payment to the plaintiff [selling lawyer] based on pending or future business, and although the evidence establishes that the plaintiff at no time did or would break down the total sales price as to the value assigned to any particular item, and although the contract provision &#x2026; providing $15,000.00 instead <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page231" class="pagebreak">231</span>of $13,750.00 as attributable to the fair value of physical assets was prompted by way of modification at defendant&#x2019;s request, it is clearly apparent to this court &#x2026; that each party considered the expectation of future business from present clients and former clients as a principal motivating factor in this transaction.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_5" id="fn-5">5</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">The court actually quoted a portion of the letter the selling lawyer sent to his clients:</p>
<p class="blockquote">All of my files and records remain intact at the above Norwalk address. In order to provide continuity in the handling of the legal affairs of the clients of my office, I was fortunate in being able to arrange for an experienced and competent attorney, Russell J. Moss, to take over at my location.</p>
<p class="blockquote">Mr. Moss, who has practiced in the Inglewood-Hawthorne area for the past sixteen years, has agreed to complete all legal matters in the office, subject to the approval of the clients involved. He has custody of all files and records of the office, including original wills which may have been drawn for you by this office.</p>
<p class="blockquote">If you have any questions or problems regarding your legal affairs, Mr. Moss will be pleased to assist you just as I would if I were available.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_6" id="fn-6">6</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">The court concluded that the parties intended the contract to really involve the future patronage of the former and current clients&#x2014;such that the parties were really selling &#x201C;goodwill&#x201D;:</p>
<p class="blockquote">The attempted sale of the expectation of future patronage by former and current clients of a law office coupled with an agreement to encourage said clients to continue to patronize the purchaser of the physical assets of the office, under the facts of this case, may well be said to constitute an attempt to buy and sell the good will of a law practice as a going business, contrary to public policy, and that the portion of the agreement purporting to so do is invalid and unenforceable.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_7" id="fn-7">7</a></sup></span></p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page232" class="pagebreak">232</div>
<p class="noindent1">This tended to be the way solo practitioners &#x201C;sold&#x201D; law firms for many years prior to the adoption of Rule 1.17&#x2014;lawyers knew not to put the details of their contracts into writing!</p>
<p class="noindent1">So how did law firms deal with adding or subtracting partners or associates prior to Rule 1.17? This was handled more subtly within the law firm itself. &#x201C;It is standard operating procedure for law firms: associates are hired and after several years rise to partner at the same time that long-serving partners retire with some form of pension.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_8" id="fn-8">8</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">What about the retiring solo practitioner? For the solo practitioner, as the lawyer discovers that retirement is looming, negotiations ensue with a younger lawyer interested in &#x201C;taking over&#x201D; the practice. The young lawyer buys into and joins the solo practitioner in a new firm named &#x201C;Old Practitioner and Successor.&#x201D; For a period of time, the two may practice together, allowing the clients to get to know the successor. Thereafter, Old Practitioner might become &#x201C;of counsel&#x201D; or withdraw from practice entirely, while the name remains a part of the firm and a continuing financial benefit flows to Old Practitioner.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_9" id="fn-9">9</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">In effect, this arrangement allowed lawyers to sell a law practice by accepting new members into the partnership. Thus, under the old rules, there was a disparity of treatment between lawyers practicing in a partnership compared to solo practitioners: these rules forbade solos from selling &#x201C;good will,&#x201D; but not law firms. Because of this difference in treatment, solos pushed changes to the rules of professional conduct regarding the sale of a law practice. Beginning in 1990, the A.B.A. and various states adopted versions of Rule 1.17, allowing for the sale of a law practice by a living lawyer, or by the estate of a deceased lawyer. In the early 2000&#x2019;s, most states updated Rule 1.17 to allow a lawyer to sell part of a practice (&#x201C;an area of law practice&#x201D;) without leaving the practice of law entirely.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 1.17 imposes various restrictions on the sale of a law practice, however. First, the seller must cease to engage in the practice of law, or an area of practice, in the jurisdiction (or a particular geographic area). Second, the seller must sell the entire practice, or the entire area of practice, to one or more lawyers or law firms. The rule justifies this restriction by arguing that the piecemeal sale of a practice would not protect clients whose matters have turned out to be less lucrative and who might find it difficult to secure other counsel if the sale were limited to substantial <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page233" class="pagebreak">233</span>fee-generating matters.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_10" id="fn-10">10</a></sup></span> Thus, Rule 1.17 forces the purchaser to subsidize those clients with less lucrative cases. The purchaser cannot avoid accepting the clients with the less lucrative cases by trying to raise their fees, because Rule 1.17(d) prohibits raising any fees because of the sale.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Third, the sale of a law practice raises questions of client confidentiality because the purchaser is not the lawyer whom the clients retained. Consequently, the seller must give each of the seller&#x2019;s clients written notice of the proposed sale, the terms of any proposed fee changes, the right to retain other counsel, and the right to take possession of his file. If the clients do not respond within 90 days, the rule presumes that the client consents.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_11" id="fn-11">11</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">If the seller cannot send actual notice to the client (perhaps he has moved without leaving a forwarding address), the seller must secure a court order authorizing the transfer. The court can determine if there have been reasonable efforts to find the client and whether it is in the legitimate interests of the absent clients to have the purchaser represent them. To protect the client&#x2019;s confidentiality, the seller may disclose to the court in camera information about the proposed representation only to the extent necessary to obtain the order.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Finally, the rule covers the sale of a law practice in the event a lawyer dies. If a law firm has more than one lawyer, the death of one of the lawyers does not end the law practice because there is at least one other lawyer to carry on the work. However, in the case of a solo practitioner who dies without having sold their practice, what happens to the files of their clients? Like most states, when Delaware added Rule 1.17, it also added Rule 5.4(a)(2). Rule 5.4 provides that if a lawyer purchases the law practice of &#x201C;a deceased, disabled, or disappeared lawyer,&#x201D; then the first lawyer may agree to pay the purchase price to the estate or other representative of the lawyer who is deceased.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Further, it is recommended that solo practitioners have a plan to provide for the protection of their clients&#x2019; interests in the event of their death, in order to assure that client matters are not neglected. The plan should designate another lawyer who would make reasonable efforts to notify the clients of the solo practitioner&#x2019;s death, review the files, and determine which need immediate attention. Because the designated lawyer does not represent these clients, she should only review as much as need to identify the clients and determine which files need immediate attention.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page234" class="pagebreak">234</div>
<h3 class="secmain" id="r1-21"><span class="bold">The Rule</span></h3>
<p class="noindent1">The rule begins with the general statement that a lawyer may sell or purchase a law practice provided the lawyer satisfies a number of conditions.</p>
<div class="blue">
<h3 class="sectiona" id="rs1-50"><img src="images/p234.jpg" alt="Image" /></h3>
<p class="box_h"><span class="bold">Sale of a Law Practice</span></p>
<p class="box-noindent">A lawyer or a law firm may sell or purchase a law practice, or an area of law practice, including good will, if the following conditions are satisfied:</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">The remainder of Rule 1.17 lists those conditions that are required for a lawyer to sell and transfer a business. Because the sale of a law practice necessarily touches upon the interests and rights of the clients, these provisions are geared towards protecting the clients&#x2019; interests.</p>
<h4 class="secsub" id="s2-57"><span class="bold">1.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Leaving Private Practice in a Jurisdiction or a Subject Area</span></h4>
<p class="noindent1">A lawyer cannot sell a law practice unless the lawyer is: (1) leaving the private practice of law entirely or (2) is leaving the private practice in a particular jurisdiction; or (3) no longer plans to practice in the subject area of the kind of cases the lawyer is selling. Rule 1.17 (a) and (b) state as follows:</p>
<div class="blue">
<h3 class="sectiona" id="rs1-51"><img src="images/p234.jpg" alt="Image" /></h3>
<p class="box_h"><span class="bold">Sale of a Law Practice</span></p>
<p class="box-noindent">A lawyer &#x2026; may sell &#x2026; a law practice &#x2026; if the following conditions are satisfied:</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(a)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The seller ceases to engage in the private practice of law, or in the area of practice that has been sold in the jurisdiction in which the practice has been conducted;</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(b)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The entire practice, or the entire area of practice, is sold to one or more lawyers or law firms;</p>
</div>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page235" class="pagebreak">235</div>
<p class="noindent">A lawyer might leave the private practice of law to retire entirely, to take up another occupation, to become a judge, or to become an in-house lawyer for a corporation. For example, Liza Lawyer may decide to leave the practice of law to retire. She might ethically sell her entire practice to Larry. A lawyer may sell her practice even if she plans to practice in another jurisdiction. Perhaps Liza lives in California. Liza might decide that she would like to move to Wisconsin and practice law there. Liza may ethically sell her entire California practice to Larry. Consider another example.</p>
<p class="image-exeL"><img src="images/exe.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="example"><span class="bolda">Example.</span> Joan Judge used to practice criminal law as a defense attorney. However, she had to sell her practice when she was appointed to the bench fifteen years ago. Recently, Joan Judge has decided to retire from the bench. She would still like to earn a modest income so she has been looking into the idea of opening a small criminal defense practice again. May Joan Judge return to the area of criminal law after having sold her practice of the same kind? Why or why not?</p>
<div class="ana">
<p class="analysis"><span class="bolda">Analysis.</span> Probably yes. Generally, the rule prohibits an attorney from returning to, or accepting new matters in regards to, an area of practice in which the attorney previously sold.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_12" id="fn-12">12</a></sup></span> However, an unanticipated change in circumstance may still satisfy the rule and not constitute a violation.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_13" id="fn-13">13</a></sup></span> Here, Joan Judge could not have maintained her criminal defense practice while she was sitting on the bench. However, Joan Judge should not be expected to suffer retirement in poverty either. Therefore, Joan Judge will probably not violate the Rule if she decides to start up a criminal defense practice again.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">It is also important to note that a lawyer may sell the entire practice <span class="italic">or a subject area of the practice</span>. A lawyer cannot, however, sell <span class="italic">certain cases</span> while keeping others of the same kind. Perhaps Liza&#x2019;s practice neatly divides into personal injury cases and divorce cases. If Liza is leaving the practice of law, Liza may sell her entire practice to Larry. Perhaps Larry specializes in personal injury representation. Larry is not interested in buying Liza&#x2019;s divorce practice. Liza may sell the personal injury practice to Larry and the divorce practice to Lori, a lawyer specializing in family law. Perhaps Liza is not leaving the practice of law at all but she has decided to specialize <span class="italic">only</span> in divorce work. She no longer wishes to handle personal injury cases. Liza may ethically sell her personal injury practice to Larry. If Liza does this, she must no longer practice personal injury law. Liza cannot sell <span class="italic">some</span> personal injury cases and keep others. What about the following example?</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page236" class="pagebreak">236</div>
<p class="image-exeL"><img src="images/exe.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="example"><span class="bolda">Example.</span> Frasier Lawyer practices personal injury law and currently represents Niles Client. Frasier Lawyer is overwhelmed by his massive caseload, but needs to keep earning as much as possible because he is working his way out of debt. After reviewing all of his files, Frasier Lawyer decides his schedule and budget would both benefit if he sold all of his current personal injury claims, where the client is seeking less than $10,000 relief, in order for him to focus on his remaining personal injury case load, in which the relief sought by clients ranges from $10,000 to $10 million. Frasier Lawyer discusses a potential sale with Martin Lawyer, a personal injury lawyer with whom Frasier Lawyer has previously associated. Martin Lawyer is willing to purchase all of Frasier Lawyer&#x2019;s current personal injury claims where the client is seeking less than $10,000 relief. May Frasier Lawyer and Martin Lawyer complete this sale? Why or why not?</p>
<div class="ana">
<p class="analysis"><span class="bolda">Analysis.</span> No, Frasier Lawyer and Martin Lawyer may not go through with this sale because it is not a sale for an entire area of practice.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_14" id="fn-14">14</a></sup></span> Here, Frasier Lawyer plans to continue practicing personal injury law; however, he would no longer be doing so on behalf of clients with less lucrative claims. The rule requires that either the entire practice or entire area of practice be sold, and there is no allowance for selling only a portion of an area of practice.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_15" id="fn-15">15</a></sup></span> Furthermore, if Frasier Lawyer decides to sell his entire personal injury practice, but wishes to still remain in the active practice of law, he cannot accept any new personal injury matters.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_16" id="fn-16">16</a></sup></span></p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">What happens if a lawyer who sold her practice later decides to return to private practice? If a lawyer sells her practice and later decides to return to private practice, the lawyer does not commit an ethical breach <span class="italic">as long as the lawyer acts in good faith</span>. No one can guarantee the future. A retired lawyer may suddenly need to return to private practice because of financial considerations. A lawyer who went in-house may decide to open a private practice again. A lawyer who becomes a judge may not be re-elected and may return to the private practice of law even when she sold her practice years ago. As long as the lawyer sold her practice in good faith, the lawyer has acted ethically.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page237" class="pagebreak">237</div>
<h4 class="secsub" id="s2-58"><span class="bold">2.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Notice to and Approval from Clients</span></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 1.17 (c) describes the different conditions that the selling lawyer must adhere to in order to sell his or her practice of law. The conditions serve to protect all of the clients&#x2019; interests. For example, the selling lawyer&#x2019;s duty of confidentiality to his or her clients under Rule 1.6 does not evaporate simply because that lawyer seeks to sell the practice. In negotiating the sale of the practice, the selling lawyer may not disclose confidential information about the clients and their matters and cannot give the potential purchaser access to client files. Once the selling and buying lawyers agree on the sale, the selling lawyer must give all clients whose matters are part of the sale notice of the sale. The clients must be told of their right to counsel of their choice, which could be someone other than the lawyer buying the practice. The clients must also be told that they can take possession of their files themselves if they desire. Finally, they must be told that their consent to the transfer of representation from the selling lawyer to the buying lawyer will be presumed if the client does not take any action within ninety days of receipt of the notice.</p>

<h3 class="sectiona" id="rs1-52"><img src="images/p234.jpg" alt="Image" /></h3>
<p class="box_h"><span class="bold">Sale of a Law Practice</span></p>
<p class="box-noindent">A lawyer or a law firm may sell or purchase a law practice, or an area of law practice, including good will, if the following conditions are satisfied:</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(a)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#x2026;</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(b)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#x2026;</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(c)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The seller gives written notice to each of the seller&#x2019;s clients regarding:</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(1)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;the proposed sale;</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(2)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;the client&#x2019;s right to retain other counsel or to take possession of the file; and</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(3)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;the client&#x2019;s consent to the transfer of the client&#x2019;s files will be presumed if the client does not take any action or does not otherwise object within ninety (90) days of receipt of the notice.</p>
</div>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page238" class="pagebreak">238</div>
<p class="noindent1">In a matter of pending litigation,<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_17" id="fn-17">17</a></sup></span> if a client cannot be given notice, the representation of that client may be transferred to the purchaser only upon entry of an order so authorizing by a court having jurisdiction&#x2026; .<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_18" id="fn-18">18</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Notice to each and every client is <span class="italic">very important</span>. The selling lawyer must give notice to all clients whose matters are a part of the sale and those clients can either choose to remain a client of the new lawyer or switch counsel.</p>
<p class="noindent1">If the selling lawyer is not able to give the requisite notice, the lawyer must obtain court authorization for the transfer of the representation. The lawyer may disclose confidential client information to the court <span class="italic">in camera</span> in an effort to obtain court authorization. The lawyer may disclose <span class="italic">only</span> that information necessary to the court&#x2019;s decision-making.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_19" id="fn-19">19</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent">Consider the following example.</p>
<p class="image-exeL"><img src="images/exe.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="example"><span class="bolda">Example.</span> Daphne Lawyer has agreed to sell her law practice to Rosalind Lawyer. Daphne Lawyer sends her clients the requisite notice regarding the proposed sale via the United States Postal Service, email, fax, and a recorded voicemail. After four months, Daphne has only received a response from 80% of her clients. Can Daphne proceed with the sale of her practice?</p>
<div class="ana">
<p class="analysis"><span class="bolda">Analysis.</span> Probably yes. Daphne Lawyer may obtain an order from a court having jurisdiction authorizing the transfer of the remaining client files.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_20" id="fn-20">20</a></sup></span> The Court would consider whether reasonable efforts to locate the client have been made.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_21" id="fn-21">21</a></sup></span> Here, Daphne Lawyer seems to have made every reasonable effort to locate her clients; therefore, the Court would probably issue an order approving the sale without the express consent of the clients who did not respond.</p>
</div>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page239" class="pagebreak">239</div>
<p class="noindent1">Note that if a matter is already before a tribunal, the tribunal must be petitioned to allow the substitution of the buying lawyer for the selling lawyer as counsel of record. Recall that the courts have significant discretion as to whether to approve or not approve of the substitution of the attorneys.</p>
<h4 class="secsub" id="s2-59"><span class="bold">3.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Sale of a Practice of a Deceased Lawyer</span></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Although Rule 1.17 does not specifically so provide, a representative of a deceased lawyer may sell the law practice of the deceased lawyer by following the procedures of Rule 1.17. Rule 5.4(a)(2) clarifies that a purchaser who pays a representative of a deceased lawyer in a sale of a law practice pursuant to Rule 1.17 does not violate the prohibitions of Rule 5.4 regarding sharing legal fees with a non-lawyer.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_22" id="fn-22">22</a></sup></span> So Rule 5.4 makes it obvious that Rule 1.17 applies to the sale of the practice of a deceased lawyer as well.</p>
<h4 class="secsub" id="s2-60"><span class="bold">4.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;No Fee Increase</span></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Finally, there can be no fee increase with regard to clients after the sale of a law practice. Part (d) of Rule 1.17 addresses this issue and states as follows:</p>

<p class="analysis"><span class="bolda">Analysis.</span> No, Mitt Lawyer cannot increase the fee Ann Client will pay for legal representation in her personal injury case because the rule clearly states, &#x201C;the fees charged clients shall not be increased by reason of the sale.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_23" id="fn-23">23</a></sup></span> Here, Mitt Lawyer wants to charge Ann Client more because he needs financing for his recently purchased law practice. This type of fee increase is explicitly prohibited by the rule.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_24" id="fn-24">24</a></sup></span> The outcome may be different if the circumstances of Ann Client&#x2019;s legal representation had changed. For example, if Ann Client was seeking representation for a separate legal matter, an additional fee may be appropriate. However, here it is clear that any fee increase is motivated by Mitt Lawyer&#x2019;s recent purchase of the practice.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 1.17 is very clear: the fee charged to clients cannot increase simply because of the sale. Rule 1.17 states clearly that the fee &#x201C;shall not be increased by reason of the sale.&#x201D;</p>

<p class="noindent1"><span class="bold">Rule 1.17</span> governs how a lawyer may sell his or her law practice. A lawyer may sell a law practice or a subject area of his or her law practice if the lawyer is leaving the private practice of law or no longer plans to practice in the subject area. The selling lawyer must fulfill the duty of competence owed to all clients; the buying lawyer must abide by the fee arrangements made between the selling lawyer and the clients, and may not increase the fee. The selling lawyer must give every affected client proper notice of the sale and notice that the client may choose to take the client&#x2019;s file to another lawyer&#x2014;or stay with the buying lawyer. However, if a client&#x2019;s matter is already before a tribunal, the selling lawyer must obtain the court&#x2019;s permission to withdraw as counsel of record and permission for the buying lawyer to become counsel of record.</p>
