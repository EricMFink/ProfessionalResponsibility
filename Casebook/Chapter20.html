<p class="image-lensL"><img src="../Casebook/images/ltt.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 5.2 provides the mirror Rule to Rule 5.1. Just as Rule 5.1 does not teach lawyers how to be a good boss, Rule 5.2 does not teach lawyers how to manage a bad boss. But, as Rule 5.1 instructs lawyers on how to be an ethical boss, Rule 5.2 in turn guides subordinate lawyers on how to navigate situations where the boss may be taking the subordinate lawyer along for a bumpy ethical ride. These rides can be bumpy, not just ethically but also professionally, because a subordinate lawyer often may not want to reject the instructions of a supervisory lawyer, as the subordinate lawyer&#x2019;s job may hang in the balance. The bottom line under the Rules of Professional Conduct, however, is clear: &#x201C;I acted under orders from the boss&#x201D; is not a defense to a clear violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>
<p class="clear"></p>
<h3 class="secmain" id="r1-18"><span class="bold">The Rule</span></h3>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 5.2 is comprised of two subsections that must be read together. Subsection (a) confirms a lawyer&#x2019;s personal responsibility to follow the Rules of Professional Conduct, regardless of whether the lawyer is acting at someone else&#x2019;s direction, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page208" class="pagebreak">208</span>while subsection (b) recognizes the propriety of a lawyer deferring to a supervisory lawyer&#x2019;s reasonable judgment in resolving a debatable ethical question.</p>
<h4 class="secsub" id="s2-54"><span class="bold">1.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Subordinate Lawyer Responsibilities</span></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 5.2 collectively establishes the responsibility of subordinate lawyers acting under the supervision of another lawyer:</p>
<div class="blue">
<h3 class="sectiona" id="rs1-46"><img src="../Casebook/images/p208.jpg" alt="Image" /></h3>
<p class="box_h"><span class="bold">Responsibilities of a Subordinate Lawyer</span></p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(a)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;A lawyer is bound by the Rules of Professional Conduct notwith-standing the fact that the lawyer acted at the direction of another person.</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(b)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;A subordinate lawyer does not violate the Rules of Professional Conduct if that lawyer acts in accordance with a supervisory lawyer&#x2019;s reasonable resolution of an arguable question of professional duty.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">Multiple lawyers commonly work together on a matter, and each of these lawyers may have different opinions about how to resolve ethical issues. The Rules of Professional Conduct recognize that &#x201C;someone has to decide upon the course of action,&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_1" id="fn-1">1</a></sup></span> or else &#x201C;a consistent course of action or position could not be taken.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_2" id="fn-2">2</a></sup></span> Thus, in circumstances where &#x201C;the question is reasonably arguable&#x201D; on a &#x201C;matter involving professional judgment as to ethical duty, the supervisor may assume responsibility for making the judgment.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_3" id="fn-3">3</a></sup></span> In these cases, if the supervisory lawyer&#x2019;s judgment is challenged, &#x201C;the supervisor&#x2019;s reasonable resolution of the question should protect the subordinate lawyer,&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_4" id="fn-4">4</a></sup></span> even if the supervisory lawyer was mistaken.</p>
<p class="noindent1">This defense applies, however, only in cases where the ethical duty was reasonably arguable. &#x201C;Reasonable&#x201D; in this context means &#x201C;the conduct of a reasonably prudent and competent lawyer.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_5" id="fn-5">5</a></sup></span> Competence further requires that the lawyer assess the ethical duty in question with the knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page209" class="pagebreak">209</span>reasonably necessary for the representation.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_6" id="fn-6">6</a></sup></span> Therefore, although a subordinate lawyer will not violate Rule 5.2 without knowledge that a supervisory lawyer&#x2019;s judgment was erroneous,<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_7" id="fn-7">7</a></sup></span> the subordinate lawyer cannot willfully turn a blind eye to a clear ethical duty and still successfully claim the supervisory-lawyer defense if the subordinate lawyer&#x2019;s conduct is challenged.</p>
<p class="noindent1">By contrast, in cases where &#x201C;the [ethical] question can reasonably be answered only one way,&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_8" id="fn-8">8</a></sup></span> the subordinate lawyer&#x2019;s duty is clear: the lawyer personally must abide by the Rules of Professional Conduct, even if the lawyer must challenge and reject the supervisory lawyer&#x2019;s instructions, even &#x201C;at the peril of losing his [or her] employment with the firm.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_9" id="fn-9">9</a></sup></span> This duty obviously can be difficult to exercise in the real world. The Rule certainly does not demand that junior lawyers regularly second-guess more experienced lawyers, whose experience can permit them to detect greater nuance in some ethical problems. Buta junior lawyer may not disregard a clear professional duty just because a supervisory lawyer, or any other person, instructed the action.</p>
<p class="noindent">Evaluate whether this lawyer is subject to discipline or instead may get a pass under Rule 5.2:</p>
<p class="image-exeL"><img src="../Casebook/images/exe.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="example"><span class="bolda">Example.</span> Lawyer Atticus was a public defender in the Anytown, U.S.A.&#x2019;s Public Defender Office, a large city law office. The criminal courts of Anytown, like many jurisdictions, imposed very high caseloads on public defenders, which stretched resources and gave public defenders little time to prepare properly. One day, Judge Taylor attempted to assign a group of new clients to Atticus. Several of the clients had complex cases. Atticus&#x2019; caseload was extremely high, and Atticus worried that he could not competently and diligently represent his clients if he assumed the additional clients. At the same time, Atticus did not want to turn his back on people who needed hard-working defense counsel like himself.</p>
<p class="example">Atticus consulted with his supervisory lawyer, and she told Atticus to take the cases. &#x201C;You don&#x2019;t want to upset old Judge Taylor,&#x201D; she said. The supervisor further explained, &#x201C;Also, we have resources in place at the office that can ensure you have adequate staff and time to work on these new cases.&#x201D; <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page210" class="pagebreak">210</span>Atticus was not so sure about his supervisor&#x2019;s advice, but he deferred to her judgment. Did Atticus properly defer to his supervisory lawyer in resolving his professional duty?</p>
<div class="ana">
<p class="analysis"><span class="bolda">Analysis.</span> Atticus may have properly deferred to his supervisor&#x2019;s judgment, depending on his knowledge of the office&#x2019;s available resources. A lawyer should not seek to avoid a judicial appointment absent good cause.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_10" id="fn-10">10</a></sup></span> Excessive caseloads, however, can challenge a lawyer&#x2019;s ability to represent a client competently and diligently.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_11" id="fn-11">11</a></sup></span> Public defenders routinely face this caseload issue around the country, and some lawyers have refused to take new cases assignments on this ground.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_12" id="fn-12">12</a></sup></span> A federal judge also rejected the judgment call of public defenders that they could handle their clients&#x2019; cases properly with the lawyers&#x2019; limited resources.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_13" id="fn-13">13</a></sup></span> And, the supervisory lawyer&#x2019;s desire to appease Judge Taylor would not alone transform Atticus&#x2019; otherwise incompetent representation into &#x201C;reasonably arguably competent representation.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_14" id="fn-14">14</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Nevertheless, whether a lawyer can competently and diligently represent particular clients within the resources of a large office can be a complex question over which the supervisor may have superior knowledge, at least of available resources.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_15" id="fn-15">15</a></sup></span> If the supervisory lawyer, for instance, expected to transfer some of Atticus&#x2019; other cases to other lawyers, to withhold Atticus from upcoming case-assignment shifts, or to assign more office staff to support Atticus&#x2019; case work, the supervisory lawyer&#x2019;s resolution of Atticus&#x2019; professional duty may have been reasonable. If so, Atticus properly deferred to his supervisor&#x2019;s judgment. If Atticus, however, knew that his supervisor merely thought, &#x201C;Atticus can handle it,&#x201D; without any factual basis for that expectation, Atticus&#x2019; acceptance of the additional cases would not be protected under Rule 5.2 if his competence and diligence were compromised.</p>

<p class="noindent1">Rule 5.2 consequently accommodates the reality that supervisory lawyers often will need to call the shots on debatable ethics questions. Yet, at the same time, Rule 5.2 confirms that lawyers may not disregard a known professional duty and seek refuge in the fact that the boss, or anyone else, directed that action.</p>

<p class="noindent1"><span class="bold">Rule 5.2</span> permits a lawyer to defer to the professional judgment of a supervisory lawyer who reasonably resolves an arguable question of professional duty. A lawyer, however, is personally bound by the Rules of Professional Conduct, notwithstanding that the lawyer acted at another person&#x2019;s direction.</p>
