<p class="image-lensL"><img src="../Casebook/images/ltt.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="noindent1">Ask a few lawyers to define their job along with their job&#x2019;s professional responsibilities. You may hear fairly diverse responses because lawyers can perform many roles with varying professional priorities. The public prosecutor, for instance, may identify some very different conceptions of her role and priorities as a lawyer than what the defense lawyers she regularly faces in court would offer. Now consider the corporate lawyer working in a large firm, the family law lawyer practicing as a solo practitioner, the lawyer working as a consultant to a large intellectual property venture, the lawyer serving as a dispute mediator, the legal services lawyer working in a rural community, the transactional lawyer providing <span class="italic">pro bono</span> litigation services on weekends to a local environmental advocacy organization, or the lawyer working as a law clerk to a federal judge. Lawyers can perform an almost <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page18" class="pagebreak">18</span>limitless range of professional roles for individuals, organizations, and communities, and each role may ask something unique from the lawyer professionally.</p>
<p class="clear"></p>
<p class="noindent1">This diversity in legal practice offers a wide range of career opportunities for lawyers. But this same role diversity can make lawyer ethics more challenging: if your professional role can shift significantly depending on what you actually do as a lawyer, your ethical responsibilities may also seem more like a moving target. Moving targets are not especially well-suited to regulation by a codified body of legal rules like the rules of professional responsibility.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The Preamble to the Rules of Professional Conduct provides an important anchor to the rules by framing a unifying purpose and function of those rules for all lawyers.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_1" id="fn-1">1</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">More specifically, the Preamble articulates a universal job description for lawyers. This job description by no means resolves ethical quandaries for lawyers. Rather, the Preamble helps lawyers to identify the different professional responsibilities they are balancing when resolving a problem under one or more of the rules.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The Scope to the Preamble advises lawyers and law students on how they should read, understand, and apply the rules as a code of ethics. The Scope thus identifies proper modes of interpreting and applying the ethical rules. The Scope further limits the rules in resolving some legal problems, including legal issues outside of pure professional responsibility questions, such as a lawyer&#x2019;s civil liability.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Lawyers and law students thus should study the Preamble and Scope carefully. The Preamble provides valuable insight into the legal profession. Moreover, the Preamble and Scope together offer an important interpretative anchor to lawyers and law students each time they analyze an ethical problem under one or more of the rules.</p>
<h3 class="secmain" id="r1-2"><span class="bold">The Rule</span></h3>
<p class="noindent1">The Preamble and Scope contain no rules enforceable by professional discipline. But, the rules, which are enforceable, are informed and guided by the Preamble and Scope.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_2" id="fn-2">2</a></sup></span> The Preamble contains 13 paragraphs identifying all lawyers&#x2019; core professional responsibilities. The Preamble further indicates how a lawyer properly can balance and prioritize those responsibilities when they conflict. The Scope, by <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page19" class="pagebreak">19</span>contrast, explains the purpose, function, and limits of the rules themselves. The Scope adds an additional seven paragraphs to this introductory section.</p>
<h4 class="secsub" id="s2-4"><span class="bold">1.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Preamble: A Lawyer&#x2019;s Responsibilities</span></h4>
<p class="noindent1">The Preamble begins by identifying every lawyer&#x2019;s three core roles &#x201C;as a member of the legal profession&#x201D;: (1) a representative of clients, (2) an officer of the legal system, and (3) a public citizen having a special responsibility for the quality of justice. Lawyers must know these core roles when working through negotiating the rules because almost &#x201C;all difficult ethical problems arise from conflict between a lawyer&#x2019;s responsibilities to clients, to the legal system, and to the lawyer&#x2019;s own interest in remaining an ethical person while earning a satisfactory living.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_3" id="fn-3">3</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">As a representative of clients, a lawyer performs four functions. First, as an <span class="italic">advisor,</span> the lawyer &#x201C;provides the client with an informed understanding of the client&#x2019;s legal rights and obligations and explains their practical limitations.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_4" id="fn-4">4</a></sup></span> This function is client-centered for the lawyer, but is also objective in nature: a lawyer must advise the client accurately and completely about legal rights and obligations.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Second, the lawyer is an <span class="italic">advocate</span> for the client. In this role, the lawyer &#x201C;<span class="italic">zealously</span> asserts the client&#x2019;s position.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_5" id="fn-5">5</a></sup></span> This function is the most partisan role a lawyer performs for a client: the role of a zealous advocate. Illustrating this point, one of the most heavily quoted expressions of zealous advocacy reads this way:</p>
<p class="blockquote">[A]n advocate, in the discharge of his duty, knows but one person in all the world, and that person is his client. To save that client by all means and expedients, and at all hazards and costs to other persons, and, amongst them, to himself, is the first and only duty; and in performing this duty he must not regard the alarm, the torments, the destruction which he may bring onto others.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_6" id="fn-6">6</a></sup></span></p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page20" class="pagebreak">20</div>
<p class="noindent1">This hyper-partisan expression of loyalty to the client has been questioned and challenged.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_7" id="fn-7">7</a></sup></span> But in one form or another, zealous advocacy remains a core feature of a lawyer&#x2019;s representational role.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_8" id="fn-8">8</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Third, as a <span class="italic">negotiator,</span> the lawyer &#x201C;seeks a result advantageous to the client but consistent with requirements of honest dealings with others.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_9" id="fn-9">9</a></sup></span> This function combines objective and partisan roles for the lawyer: the lawyer negotiates with the goal of advantageous outcomes for the client, but in that process, the lawyer must honor the <span class="italic">requirement</span> of honest dealings with third parties.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Fourth, the lawyer <span class="italic">evaluates</span> on behalf of the client. In this role, &#x201C;the lawyer acts by examining a client&#x2019;s legal affairs and reporting about them to the client or others.&#x201D; This function focuses on a more objective role for the lawyer: a lawyer must provide an accurate reporting to the client of the lawyer&#x2019;s examination of the client&#x2019;s legal affairs.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In addition to representing clients, a lawyer is also an officer of the legal system. The law empowers the lawyer&#x2019;s ability to represent clients, so the lawyer is expected to honor the law. Thus, &#x201C;[a] lawyer&#x2019;s conduct should conform to the requirements of the law, both in professional service to clients and in the lawyer&#x2019;s business and personal affairs.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_10" id="fn-10">10</a></sup></span> A lawyer further should use the law only for legitimate purposes,<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_11" id="fn-11">11</a></sup></span> and should demonstrate respect for the legal system and for the persons who serve it.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_12" id="fn-12">12</a></sup></span> Even when challenging the law or official action, the lawyer has a &#x201C;duty to uphold legal processes.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_13" id="fn-13">13</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Finally, the Preamble requires lawyers to act as &#x201C;public citizens&#x201D; who &#x201C;should seek improvement of the law, access to the legal system, the administration of justice and the quality of service rendered by the legal profession.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_14" id="fn-14">14</a></sup></span> Recognizing that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page21" class="pagebreak">21</span>the law is more than a technical trade but a &#x201C;learned profession,&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_15" id="fn-15">15</a></sup></span> the Preamble obliges lawyers to serve as stewards of the legal system, for the benefit not just of that system, but for society as a whole. A principal commitment of lawyers in fulfilling this function should be to improve access to justice for persons of limited or no means&#x2014;either directly through <span class="italic">pro bono legal services, or indirectly through &#x201C;civic influence.&#x201D;</span><span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_16" id="fn-16">16</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">This universal job description established by the Preamble fills every lawyer&#x2019;s professional plate with a broad range of important priorities and responsibilities. It is easy to imagine how these professional responsibilities sometimes could conflict with each other, particularly when a lawyer&#x2019;s interest in earning money is added to the mix.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_17" id="fn-17">17</a></sup></span> The Preamble notes that specific rules &#x201C;often prescribe terms for resolving such conflicts.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_18" id="fn-18">18</a></sup></span> But, terms for conflict resolution do not mean cookie-cutter solutions. To the contrary, even under the rules, &#x201C;many difficult issues of professional discretion can arise.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_19" id="fn-19">19</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">The Preamble admonishes that when exercising this discretion, a lawyer must exercise &#x201C;sensitive professional and moral judgment,&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_20" id="fn-20">20</a></sup></span> relying on various principles and sources. The lawyer, for example, must remain faithful to the obligation to protect and pursue a client&#x2019;s interests zealously. Indeed, as the Preamble acknowledges, the duty of zealous advocacy plays an important role in our adversary system of justice.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_21" id="fn-21">21</a></sup></span> Thus, &#x201C;when an opposing party is well represented, a lawyer can be a zealous advocate on behalf of a client and at the same time assume that justice is being done.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_22" id="fn-22">22</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">The lawyer&#x2019;s advocacy, however, must remain within the bounds of the law. In identifying the bounds of the law, the lawyer cannot limit him or herself to the ethical rules in isolation. Other substantive and procedural law may govern ethical issues, such as discovery rules, the law of evidence, or the U.S. Constitution.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_23" id="fn-23">23</a></sup></span> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page22" class="pagebreak">22</span>Beyond positive law, lawyers&#x2019; ethical discretion is &#x201C;also guided by personal conscience and the approbation of peers.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_24" id="fn-24">24</a></sup></span> Moreover, the Preamble directs lawyers to &#x201C;maintain[] a professional, courteous, and civil attitude toward all persons involve in the legal system,&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_25" id="fn-25">25</a></sup></span> and to &#x201C;strive to attain the highest level of skill.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_26" id="fn-26">26</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">All these professional responsibilities may seem uniquely difficult and burdensome. This professional responsibility framework, however, reflects the fact that &#x201C;[t]he legal profession is largely self-governing.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_27" id="fn-27">27</a></sup></span> The legal profession is believed to depend on this political independence for lawyers properly to pursue their special role &#x201C;in the preservation of society.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_28" id="fn-28">28</a></sup></span> As a result, rather than being subject to legislative or administrative oversight, the legal profession principally is governed by the courts and members of the bar themselves.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_29" id="fn-29">29</a></sup></span> Yet, as the Preamble observes, only &#x201C;[t]o the extent that lawyers meet the obligations of their professional calling, the occasion for government regulation is obviated.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_30" id="fn-30">30</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent">To get a sense of how difficult the task sometimes can be to meet all the obligations of a lawyer&#x2019;s professional calling, consider this lawyer&#x2019;s predicament:</p>
<p class="image-exeL"><img src="../Casebook/images/exe.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="example"><span class="bolda">Example.</span> Lawyer Larry represented Donna in a personal injury lawsuit brought by Paul. Paul sued Donna for injuries Paul sustained as a passenger in a vehicle accident when Donna was the driver of the vehicle. During settlement negotiations, Paul&#x2019;s doctor examined Paul and determined that Paul&#x2019;s injuries included rib cage and tissue injuries, along with a concussion. Several weeks later, Larry retained a doctor to examine Paul independently. This doctor confirmed the prior doctor&#x2019;s test results, but also detected an aortic aneurysm. According to this doctor, the aneurysm presented &#x201C;a serious matter as far as Paul&#x2019;s life. This aneurysm may dilate further and rupture which would cause immediate death.&#x201D; This doctor could not determine whether the accident caused the aneurysm, which may have been present for some time. But the accident could have caused the aneurysm, which might not manifest for several weeks after the accident, explaining the first doctor&#x2019;s inability to detect it. Unaware of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page23" class="pagebreak">23</span>aneurysm, Paul&#x2019;s lawyer agreed to settle for a modest amount of damages. Larry knew that Paul&#x2019;s lawyer likely would increase the settlement offer exponentially if she knew about the aneurysm. Larry also knew from his own doctor that Paul could avoid the risk of death from the aneurysm through surgery if Paul learned of the condition. According to the Preamble to the rules, how should Larry advise Donna regarding the settlement offer?<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_31" id="fn-31">31</a></sup></span></p>
<div class="ana">
<p class="analysis"><span class="bolda">Analysis.</span> This circumstance presents Donna with the opportunity to capitalize on Paul&#x2019;s lack of knowledge about his own medical condition. This legal decision, however, raises a serious moral question&#x2014;whether Donna should allow Paul to risk an avoidable death to reduce Donna&#x2019;s liability, and perhaps Larry&#x2019;s own bottom line.</p>
<p class="analysis">Larry has several options of how to advise Donna about this decision. For instance, Larry simply could advise Donna objectively about the pros and cons of this decision, and leave the choice to Donna. This decision would remove Larry somewhat from whatever decision Donna chose. But this decision would not advocate zealously for Donna&#x2019;s decision, and would not involve particularly candid advice. Nor would this decision by Larry accept real responsibility for the moral dilemma of whether to inform Paul of his medical condition.</p>
<p class="analysis">In another option, Larry could advise Donna to protect herself from liability by authorizing Larry to settle promptly and withhold the information about Paul&#x2019;s medical condition. This decision certainly would advance Donna&#x2019;s financial interests &#x201C;at all costs and hazards to other persons.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_32" id="fn-32">32</a></sup></span> But this decision also would accept Paul&#x2019;s avoidable death as a legitimate cost of the client&#x2019;s benefit. This decision may prove too morally questionable for some lawyers&#x2014; or clients, for that matter&#x2014;to handle, regardless of how financially beneficial the decision might be for the client and lawyer.</p>
<p class="analysis">In yet another option, Larry could contact Paul&#x2019;s lawyer independently to inform Paul of his medical condition. This decision might seem morally palatable for many individuals. This decision also might appear more consistent with the duty of honest dealing. Yet, this decision would A.B.A.ndon any loyalty to the client by disclosing confidential information without the client&#x2019;s authorization or concern for the client&#x2019;s interest in how to resolve the matter. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page24" class="pagebreak">24</span>This decision additionally could undermine Larry&#x2019;s own remuneration from the litigation, depending on the nature of his fee with Donna.</p>
<p class="analysis">As this problem illustrates, the Preamble does not give Larry a firm answer for how to resolve this dilemma. Nor, as you will learn shortly, do the rules definitively solve this problem.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_33" id="fn-33">33</a></sup></span> But before Larry goes to the rules for guidance, the Preamble lets him think about the competing professional responsibilities at stake, and in the process, helps Larry to frame the issues more clearly for an analysis under the rules.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="secsub" id="s2-5"><span class="bold">2.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The Scope</span></h4>
<p class="noindent1">The Scope section of the rules supplies a number of important interpretative considerations for working with the rules themselves. The Scope begins by noting that the rules fundamentally &#x201C;are rules of reason,&#x201D; and &#x201C;should be interpreted with reference to the purposes of legal representation and the law itself.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_34" id="fn-34">34</a></sup></span> Critical to reading the rules as rules of reason, the Scope notes, is whether the particular rule is cast an as imperative, an aspiration, or a discretionary judgment call. The rules use terms like &#x201C;shall&#x201D; and &#x201C;shall not,&#x201D; for example, to identify imperatives that establish legal obligations.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_35" id="fn-35">35</a></sup></span> &#x201C;Should,&#x201D; by contrast, denotes an aspiration: a lawyer&#x2019;s choices are encouraged but not obligatory.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_36" id="fn-36">36</a></sup></span> If a rule instead employs the term &#x201C;may,&#x201D; the rule is &#x201C;permissive and define[s] areas &#x2026; in which the lawyer has discretion to exercise professional judgment.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_37" id="fn-37">37</a></sup></span></p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page25" class="pagebreak">25</div>
<p class="noindent1">This framework demonstrates that the rules are &#x201C;partly obligatory and disciplinary and partly constitutive and descriptive.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_38" id="fn-38">38</a></sup></span> Within this framework, the rules &#x201C;presuppose a larger legal context shaping the lawyer&#x2019;s role.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_39" id="fn-39">39</a></sup></span> This legal context includes court rules and statutes creating lawyer responsibilities, such as discovery rules,<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_40" id="fn-40">40</a></sup></span> as well as substantive and procedural law that regulates lawyer conduct.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_41" id="fn-41">41</a></sup></span> In addition to this legal context, &#x201C;moral and ethical considerations &#x2026; should inform a lawyer, for no worthwhile human activity can be completely defined by legal rules.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_42" id="fn-42">42</a></sup></span> The rules thus recognize the inherent limitations of a code of professional ethics, and the rules should be construed in this light&#x2014;&#x201C;a framework for the ethical practice of law.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_43" id="fn-43">43</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent">Consider how the Scope helps to orient the analysis of this lawyer&#x2019;s professional responsibility:</p>
<p class="image-exeL"><img src="../Casebook/images/exe.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="example"><span class="bolda">Example.</span> Client Cathie filed a bar complaint against Lawyer Sam. Cathie alleged that Sam did not competently handle a real estate transaction for Cathie. To defend against the bar complaint, Sam disclosed confidential information from his representation of Cathie that he judged was reasonably necessary to refute Cathie&#x2019;s claim of incompetence. This confidential information, once disclosed, compromised Cathie&#x2019;s position in the real estate matter. Cathie accordingly sued Sam for malpractice, arguing that Sam&#x2019;s violation of his duty of confidentiality prima facie breached his duty of care to Cathie in tort. Does Cathie have a legitimate civil claim against Sam?</p>
<div class="ana">
<p class="analysis"><span class="bolda">Analysis.</span> Sam had an ethical duty to maintain confidentiality with Cathie, even as a former client.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_44" id="fn-44">44</a></sup></span> This duty provided that Sam &#x201C;shall not reveal&#x201D; confidential information, an ethical imperative. But, as the Scope explains, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page26" class="pagebreak">26</span>even if Sam violated that ethical duty, that violation alone did not create a presumption that Sam violated an actionable duty of care in malpractice. Cathie would need to demonstrate that Sam&#x2019;s disclosure of confidential information breached a recognized civil duty of care.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_45" id="fn-45">45</a></sup></span> Sam&#x2019;s conduct under his ethical duty of confidentiality, however, could be admissible as relevant to that duty of care.</p>
<p class="analysis">Moreover, Sam disclosed confidential information in response to Cathie&#x2019;s bar complaint. The rules include an exception to the duty of confidentiality that permitted Sam to disclose confidential information when reasonably necessary to defend against a bar complaint.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_46" id="fn-46">46</a></sup></span> This exception did not <span class="italic">require S</span>am to disclose this information, but the exception provided that Sam &#x201C;may&#x201D; disclose. The decision whether to disclose thus rested with Sam&#x2019;s discretionary judgment, and &#x201C;[n]o disciplinary action should be taken when the lawyer chooses not to act or acts within the bounds of such discretion.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_47" id="fn-47">47</a></sup></span> Thus, to the extent that Sam&#x2019;s ethical duty of confidentiality might be relevant to whether Sam breached a civil duty of care to Cathie, so would be the discretion the rules afforded to Sam in deciding whether to disclose in this context.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">The Scope also advises on how the Comments apply to the rules. The Comments to each rule play an important interpretative role. The Scope explains this role:</p>
<p class="noindent1">The Comments accompanying each Rule explain and illustrate the meaning and purpose of the Rule. The Comments are intended as guides to interpretation, but the text of each Rule is authoritative.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_48" id="fn-48">48</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">A lawyer therefore cannot be disciplined for violating a Comment to the rules, only for violating a rule itself.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_49" id="fn-49">49</a></sup></span> But, the Comments are a critical, interpretative resource for construing the rules.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The Preamble and Scope are easy to overlook. But these sections of the rules are critical resources because they &#x201C;provide general orientation&#x201D; to the rules&#x2019; purpose <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page27" class="pagebreak">27</span>and application to specific problems.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_50" id="fn-50">50</a></sup></span> Lawyers and law students thus would do well to consult these sections when applying the rules&#x2014;especially in the many cases where the text of a rule does not provide straightforward resolution of a particular ethical problem.</p>

<p class="quick" id="qs1-3"><span class="bold">Quick Summary</span></p>
<p class="fold-L1"><img src="../Casebook/images/fold1.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="noindent1">The Preamble and Scope provide general orientation to the rules. The Preamble defines a lawyer&#x2019;s three core roles under the rules: (1) the representation of clients, (2) an officer of the legal system, and (3) a public citizen having special responsibility for the quality of justice. Many ethical dilemmas for lawyers arise when these responsibilities conflict with each other or the lawyer&#x2019;s interest in earning a satisfactory living. The Scope provides interpretative guidance to the rules, such as the meaning of obligatory rather than permissive responsibilities, and the role of the Comments to the rules.</p>

<p class="fn_list1"><span class="bold"><a href="#fn-33" id="fn_33">33</a></span>&#xA0;&#xA0;In the <span class="italic">Spaulding</span> case, the precise issue was whether the settlement agreement would be enforced despite the plaintiff&#x2019;s lack of knowledge of the aneurysm condition.
