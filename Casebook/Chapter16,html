<h3 class="secmain" id="int1-16"><span class="bold">Introduction</span></h3>
<p class="image-lensL"><img src="../Casebook/images/ltt.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="noindent1">After your prospective client consultation, the time arrives to decide whether to represent the client. A lawyer cannot accept every case: a lawyer may not be competent for the representation, a lawyer may not have the workload bandwidth, a lawyer may have a conflict of interest, or a lawyer simply may not want to work with the particular client or on the particular matter. One thing, however, is certain: the better a lawyer screens her or his cases before accepting representation, the less likely the lawyer will need to withdraw from cases unexpectedly. Withdrawal from representation can be a difficult, and sometimes costly, proposition.</p>
<p class="clear"></p>
<p class="noindent1">But before you consider the rules of accepting and withdrawing from representation, you need to understand the point at which someone becomes a lawyer&#x2019;s client. The sequence may sometimes be straightforward&#x2014;from stranger, to prospective <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page162" class="pagebreak">162</span>client, and to client, by mutual and express understanding. But sometimes the circumstances leading to a client-lawyer relationship are more fluid or informal. Unfortunately, the Rules of Professional Conduct provide very little guidance about the formation of a client-lawyer relationship. Instead, you will need to turn to other sources to determine when a client-lawyer relationship forms.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The American Law Institute Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers recites the general rule about the formation of a client-lawyer relationship:</p>
<div class="blue">
<p class="box_h" id="int-1"><span class="bold">&#xA7; 14: Formation of a Client-Lawyer Relationship</span></p>
<p class="box-noindent">A relationship of client and lawyer arises when:</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(1)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;A person manifests to a lawyer the person&#x2019;s intent that the lawyer provide legal services for the person; and either</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(a)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;the lawyer manifests to the person consent to do so; or</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(b)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;the lawyer fails to manifest lack of consent to do so, and the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the person reasonably relies on the lawyer to provide the services;</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">This objective test crystallizes an important consideration for lawyers: a lawyer bears the risk of any reasonable mistake in whether the lawyer has accepted representation. Thus, if the lawyer has not disclaimed an intent to represent someone, and based on a consultation or other circumstances that person reasonably believes that the lawyer represents him or her, the lawyer does represent that person, even if the lawyer does not intend to. Good reason to be very clear when consulting with a prospective client about whether you will accept representation, because you do not want to fall into representation that you cannot easily terminate because of limitations on a lawyer&#x2019;s ability to withdraw from representation.</p>
<p class="noindent1">A lawyer&#x2019;s freedom to reject a client alleviates this concern. As the Restatement notes, a lawyer is not a public utility. Therefore, absent some other duty to accept representation, a lawyer typically may reject a client or case for essentially any reason&#x2014;even reasons for which many businesses might not be able to reject a customer. Why do you think the law permits lawyers so freely to reject clients, even for reasons that might seem selfish or discriminatory in other contexts?</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page163" class="pagebreak">163</div>
<h3 class="secmain" id="r1-14"><span class="bold">The Rule</span></h3>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 1.16 is comprised of four subsections. Subsection (a) identifies circumstances when a lawyer must decline representation or withdraw from representation. Subsection (b) identifies circumstances of good cause when a lawyer may withdraw from representation. Subsections (c) and (d) condition a lawyer&#x2019;s ability to withdraw on fulfilling other duties.</p>
<h4 class="secsub" id="s2-42"><span class="bold">1.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Mandatory Declining or Withdrawing from Representation</span></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 1.16 establishes circumstances where a lawyer must decline to accept representation or must withdraw from representation:</p>
<div class="blue">
<h3 class="sectiona" id="rs1-33"><img src="../Casebook/images/p163.jpg" alt="Image" /></h3>
<p class="box_h"><span class="bold">Declining or Terminating Representation</span></p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(a)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Except as stated in paragraph (c), a lawyer shall not represent a client, or, where representation has commenced, shall withdraw from representation of a client if:</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(1)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;the representation will result in a violation of the rules of professional conduct or other law;</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(2)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;the lawyer&#x2019;s physical or mental condition materially impairs the lawyer&#x2019;s ability to represent the client; or</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(3)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;the lawyer is discharged.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">This Rule prevents a lawyer from accepting or continuing representation that will cause the lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct. In particular, &#x201C;[a] lawyer should not accept representation in a matter unless it can be performed competently, promptly, without improper conflict of interest and to completion.&#x201D; A lawyer also should not take or maintain a case when the client expects the lawyer to engage in illegal conduct in representing the client. In this respect, this Rule distinguishes between a client who demands illegal conduct from the lawyer and a client who suggests it, but may be persuaded by the lawyer to A.B.A.ndon the idea.</p>
<p class="noindent1">While Rule 1.16 recognizes a lawyer&#x2019;s ability to withdraw, Rule 1.16(a)(3) also recognizes the authority of a client to discharge a lawyer. &#x201C;A client has a right to discharge a lawyer at any time, with or without cause, subject to liability for payment for the lawyer&#x2019;s services.&#x201D; This Rule permits a degree of client control over <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page164" class="pagebreak">164</span>the lawyer&#x2019;s employment to preserve the client&#x2019;s autonomy in confidently securing legal services. One major exception to this client right involves clients with lawyers appointed at public expense&#x2014;usually defendants in criminal cases&#x2014;who may be required to demonstrate good cause for replacing counsel. But if the client has money to pay for counsel, the client may fire the lawyer at any time.</p>
<p class="noindent">Evaluate the role of Rule 1.16(a) in this lawyer&#x2019;s circumstance:</p>
<p class="image-exeL"><img src="../Casebook/images/exe.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="example"><span class="bolda">Example.</span> Lawyer Litigator was hired by the mother of a minor who was injured in an automobile accident. The minor was being driven by his maternal grandparent when the collision occurred with a truck. Minor&#x2019;s mother is also the minor&#x2019;s guardian ad litem. The mother argued strenuously that Litigator should sue the truck driver but not the grandparent. Litigator&#x2019;s investigation, however, demonstrated in Litigator&#x2019;s judgment that the truck driver was negligence-free and that the grandparent&#x2019;s negligent driving caused the minor&#x2019;s injuries. The mother nevertheless stated, &#x201C;Suing his grandparent does not help him. I speak for my son as his guardian. Sue the truck driver only.&#x201D; What is Litigator&#x2019;s professional responsibility?</p>
<div class="ana">
<p class="analysis"><span class="bolda">Analysis.</span> As the minor&#x2019;s guardian, the mother does have some authority to speak for the minor in determining the objectives of representation, including possibly not suing the grandparent despite a meritorious claim.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_1" id="fn-1">1</a></sup></span> But, if Litigator believed that a claim against the truck driver would be frivolous under Rule 3.1, Litigator must move to withdraw from the representation if the mother insists on that course of action.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_2" id="fn-2">2</a></sup></span></p>
</div>
<h4 class="secsub" id="s2-43"><span class="bold">2.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Discretionary Withdrawal</span></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 1.16(b) establishes the circumstances when a lawyer may withdraw, even if withdrawal is not required under subsection (a):</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page165" class="pagebreak">165</div>
<div class="blue">
<h3 class="sectiona" id="rs1-34"><img src="../Casebook/images/p163.jpg" alt="Image" /></h3>
<p class="box_h"><span class="bold">Declining or Terminating Representation</span></p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(b)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Except as stated in paragraph (c), a lawyer may withdraw from representing a client if:</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(1)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;withdrawal can be accomplished without material adverse effect on the interests of the client;</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(2)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;the client persists in a course of action involving the lawyer&#x2019;s services that the lawyer reasonably believes is criminal or fraudulent;</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(3)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;the client has used the lawyer&#x2019;s services to perpetrate a crime or fraud;</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(4)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;the client insists on taking action that the lawyer considers repugnant or with which the lawyer has a fundamental disagreement;</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(5)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;the client fails substantially to fulfill an obligation to the lawyer regarding the lawyer&#x2019;s services and has been given reasonable warning that the lawyer will withdraw unless the obligation is fulfilled;</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(6)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;the representation will result in an unreasonable financial burden on the lawyer or has been rendered unreasonably difficult by the client; or</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(7)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;other good cause for withdrawal exists.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">Note the implicit message of this Rule: if withdrawal is not required, a lawyer may not withdraw without good cause, unless the withdrawal will not harm the client&#x2019;s interests. Lawyers thus have the opposite rule from a client concerning termination. The client, you have learned, may terminate the lawyer&#x2019;s services at any time, with or without cause. By contrast, absent good cause, a lawyer should represent the client until representation on the matter is completed.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_3" id="fn-3">3</a></sup></span> &#x201C;Ordinarily, a representation in a matter is completed when the agreed-upon assistance has been concluded.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_4" id="fn-4">4</a></sup></span> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page166" class="pagebreak">166</span>How should a lawyer determine the scope of the agreed-upon assistance if the scope was not clear? Recall that the test governing the formation of a client-lawyer relationship is objective, from the client&#x2019;s perspective.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_5" id="fn-5">5</a></sup></span> This objective test may judge the scope of that relationship as well.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_6" id="fn-6">6</a></sup></span> Thus, absent good cause to withdraw, the lawyer may remain on the hook to conclude representation according to the scope of representation on which the client reasonably relied in retaining the lawyer.</p>
<h4 class="secsub" id="s2-44"><span class="bold">3.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Permission of the Tribunal</span></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Note that both subsections (a) and (b) of Rule 1.16 provide, &#x201C;Except as stated in paragraph (c).&#x201D; Paragraph (c) limits those provisions when the withdrawing lawyer represents a client in court:</p>
<div class="blue">
<h3 class="sectiona" id="rs1-35"><img src="../Casebook/images/p163.jpg" alt="Image" /></h3>
<p class="box_h"><span class="bold">Declining or Terminating Representation</span></p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(c)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;A lawyer must comply with applicable law requiring notice to or permission of a tribunal when terminating a representation. When ordered to do so by a tribunal, a lawyer shall continue representation notwithstanding good cause for terminating representation.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">When a lawyer appears in court to represent a client, the lawyer files a &#x201C;notice of appearance&#x201D; or a similarly termed instrument.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_7" id="fn-7">7</a></sup></span> This notice identifies the lawyer as the lawyer of record for the client in that tribunal. A notice of appearance may have many implications for the lawyer, for example regarding service of process and default notices.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_8" id="fn-8">8</a></sup></span> But under Rule 1.6(c), the notice of appearance places a significant obstacle between the lawyer and withdrawal: a lawyer may not withdraw after filing a notice of appearance in a tribunal without the permission of that court <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page167" class="pagebreak">167</span>or complying with other law governing withdrawal in a tribunal. Courts typically publish rules governing how to withdraw properly in different circumstances.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_9" id="fn-9">9</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">This Rule can mandate that lawyers remain on cases for a long time, sometimes at great burden, until the court permits the lawyer to withdraw.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_10" id="fn-10">10</a></sup></span> Indeed, this Rule recognizes that the court may say no to the withdrawal motion. For instance, a court may deny an otherwise valid motion to withdraw if the withdrawal motion was made on the eve of trial, because of the prejudice to the opposing party or to the court.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_11" id="fn-11">11</a></sup></span> In this circumstance, as Rule 1.16(c) requires, a lawyer must continue to represent the client.</p>
<p class="noindent">Consider whether this lawyer properly sought to withdraw:</p>
<p class="image-exeL"><img src="../Casebook/images/exe.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="example"><span class="bolda">Example.</span> Lawyer Green represented Deadbeat in a criminal case involving an alleged drug sale. Green was retained, and Deadbeat paid a percentage of the fee at the beginning of the case, with the remainder due prior to any trial. As the day of trial approached, Deadbeat made clear that he could not pay the remainder of Green&#x2019;s fee. Green gave Deadbeat repeated notice of his need to pay the outstanding fee. When Deadbeat refused, Green filed a motion to withdraw, consistent with the local court&#x2019;s rules. The judge did not rule on the motion, however, before the case was referred to trial. What was Green&#x2019;s professional responsibility?</p>
<div class="ana">
<p class="analysis"><span class="bolda">Analysis.</span> Green had good cause to move to withdraw from representing the client, because the client &#x201C;fail[ed] substantially to fulfill an obligation to the lawyer.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_12" id="fn-12">12</a></sup></span> Nevertheless, as counsel of record in this court, Green could not withdraw without permission of the court. In the meantime, Green was required to &#x201C;continue to provide competent representation to the client until relief [was] given.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_13" id="fn-13">13</a></sup></span> Green could seek a continuance pending resolution of his motion to withdraw, if the continuance would not harm the client&#x2019;s <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page168" class="pagebreak">168</span>interests.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_14" id="fn-14">14</a></sup></span> But even if Green had to try the case, he was not relieved of his &#x201C;obligation to the client until permission [was] granted by the court.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_15" id="fn-15">15</a></sup></span></p>
</div>
<h4 class="secsub" id="s2-45"><span class="bold">4.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Protecting Client Interests</span></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 1.16(d) requires lawyers to remain loyal to client interests, even upon withdrawal:</p>
<div class="blue">
<h3 class="sectiona" id="rs1-36"><img src="../Casebook/images/p163.jpg" alt="Image" /></h3>
<p class="box_h"><span class="bold">Declining or Terminating Representation</span></p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(d)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practical to protect a client&#x2019;s interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of fee or expense that has not been earned or incurred. The lawyer may retain papers relating to the client to the extent permitted by other law.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">If a lawyer and client part ways mutually, the lawyer may have every instinct to help the client during their conscious decoupling. But sometimes, a client-lawyer relationship does not end so gleefully. The client may have made the lawyer&#x2019;s life unreasonably difficult, justifying the lawyer&#x2019;s withdrawal.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_16" id="fn-16">16</a></sup></span> Or the client may have canned the lawyer for no good reason, after the lawyer exerted substantial effort to represent the client effectively. Nevertheless, because of the lawyer&#x2019;s duties to a client, &#x201C;even if the lawyer has been unfairly discharged by the client, a lawyer must take all reasonable steps to mitigate the consequences to the client.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_17" id="fn-17">17</a></sup></span></p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page169" class="pagebreak">169</div>
<p class="noindent">Consider this common issue relating to a lawyer&#x2019;s withdrawal:</p>
<p class="image-exeL"><img src="../Casebook/images/exe.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="example"><span class="bolda">Example.</span> Lawyer Green properly withdrew from representing client Deadbeat. Deadbeat still owed Green a lot of money for the unpaid fees. Deadbeat requested all of the file documents in Green&#x2019;s possession regarding Deadbeat&#x2019;s case. Green responded, &#x201C;Many of those documents are my work product, so you don&#x2019;t get them, especially when you don&#x2019;t pay. If you don&#x2019;t pay within six months, I&#x2019;m destroying your file rather than pay to store it.&#x201D; Did Green violate Rule 1.16(d)?</p>
<div class="ana">
<p class="analysis"><span class="bolda">Analysis.</span> The propriety of a lawyer retaining or destroying a client file is a commonly addressed issue in state ethics law relating to Rule 1.16(d). Much of a client file will be the property of the client, to which the client will be entitled.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_18" id="fn-18">18</a></sup></span> Some jurisdictions require a lawyer to surrender the whole file to the client upon request, including the lawyer&#x2019;s own work notes and memoranda. Other jurisdictions, however, allow a lawyer to retain his or her own work product if not necessary to the client&#x2019;s representation.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_19" id="fn-19">19</a></sup></span> If a client has not requested the file, some jurisdictions have set timetables for when a lawyer may destroy the file, and other jurisdictions state factors the lawyer should consider in deciding how long to retain client files.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_20" id="fn-20">20</a></sup></span> A lawyer, however, &#x201C;may retain papers as a security for a fee only to the extent permitted by law.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_21" id="fn-21">21</a></sup></span> If Green&#x2019;s jurisdiction did not authorize him to retain Deadbeat&#x2019;s file as a security lien, Green could not refuse to surrender the file to coerce a fee payment&#x2014;even if Deadbeat unreasonably refused to pay.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 1.16 therefore guides lawyers, along with other authorities, on the formation and termination of the client-lawyer relationship. In some circumstances, a lawyer may not accept or continue representation. Otherwise, having accepted representation, a lawyer should represent the client to the completion of the matter, unless the lawyer has good cause to withdraw. If withdrawing from a tribunal proceeding, the lawyer will need court permission. Finally, the lawyer must reasonably protect the client&#x2019;s interests upon withdrawal.</p>

<p class="noindent1"><span class="bold">Rule 1.16(a)</span> identifies the circumstances when a lawyer must decline or terminate representation: (1) when the representation will result in a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct; (2) the lawyer&#x2019;s mental or physical condition will materially impair representation; or (3) the client discharges the lawyer. A lawyer should complete the representation, unless the lawyer has good cause to withdraw under Rule 1.16(b). Rule 1.16(c) mandates court permission before the lawyer may terminate representation in a tribunal, and Rule 1.16(d) requires the lawyer reasonably to protect the client&#x2019;s interests upon withdrawal.</p>
