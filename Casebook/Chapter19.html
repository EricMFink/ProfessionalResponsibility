<p class="image-lensL"><img src="../Casebook/images/ltt.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="noindent1">Everyone hates a bad boss. But for lawyers, the Rules of Professional Conduct can make an ethical issue out of a bad lawyer boss. You very likely will supervise other lawyers and non-lawyers at some point in your career, and almost certainly you will be a subordinate lawyer to a &#x201C;boss&#x201D; lawyer. Accordingly, you need to know the difference between a bad boss for business purposes and an unethical boss under the Rules of Professional Conduct, and how you, as a lawyer, should respond to an unethical boss.</p>
<p class="clear"></p>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 5.1 identifies the responsibilities of a supervisory lawyer when managing other lawyers in a law firm. Working closely with this Rule, Rule 5.2 establishes the responsibilities of a subordinate lawyer when working at the direction of a supervisory lawyer. Rule 5.3, in turn, confirms the duties of a supervisory lawyer over non-lawyer assistants. Finally, Rule 5.4 makes clear that only lawyers themselves can own and manage a law practice.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page200" class="pagebreak">200</div>
<h3 class="secmain" id="r1-17"><span class="bold">The Rule</span></h3>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 5.1 is divided into three subsections. Subsection (a) identifies a supervisory lawyer&#x2019;s broad responsibility for maintaining an ethical law firm. Subsection (b) addresses a supervisory lawyer&#x2019;s responsibility when directly supervising another lawyer. Finally, subsection (c) establishes a type of vicarious liability a supervisory lawyer may face for the misconduct of another lawyer when the supervisory lawyer orders, ratifies, or fails to remedy the subordinate lawyer&#x2019;s misconduct.</p>
<h4 class="secsub" id="s2-51"><span class="bold">1.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Office Supervision</span></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 5.1(a) establishes the level of responsibility that lawyers with firm-level supervisory authority have over other lawyers in that firm:</p>
<div class="blue">
<h3 class="sectiona" id="rs1-43"><img src="../Casebook/images/p200.jpg" alt="Image" /></h3>
<p class="box_h"><span class="bold">Responsibility of Partners, Managers, and Supervisory Lawyers</span></p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(a)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;A partner in a law firm, and a lawyer who individually or together with other lawyers possesses comparable managerial authority in a law firm, shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving reasonable assurance that all lawyers in the firm conform to the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">When lawyers associate in a firm, some lawyers may hold an acknowledged managerial or supervisory role over other lawyers. Firm partners will hold this position relative to firm associates, and other lawyers may be given the title of &#x201C;supervisor&#x201D; or &#x201C;director&#x201D; regardless of partner or associate status within the firm. In firms without an express management hierarchy, such as a small firm of experienced lawyers, all the lawyers in the firm may exercise managerial authority over the firm as a whole.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_1" id="fn-1">1</a></sup></span> These supervisory lawyers of course run or manage the firm as a business, but under Rule 5.1(a), these supervisory lawyers also are ethically accountable for ensuring that all the lawyers in the firm practice ethically.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 5.1(a) does not make supervisory lawyers vicariously liable for the misconduct of every lawyer in the firm. Indeed, &#x201C;[a]part from this Rule and Rule 8.4(a), a lawyer does not have disciplinary liability for the conduct of a partner, associate or <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page201" class="pagebreak">201</span>subordinate.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_2" id="fn-2">2</a></sup></span> Rather, this Rule makes a supervisory lawyer independently subject to discipline if he or she does not maintain a firm environment that reasonably assures that all lawyers in the firm comport with the Rules of Professional Conduct. This Rule thus focuses on firm policies and practices for which supervisory lawyers are responsible.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Examples of the firm policies and practices commonly necessary for a supervisory lawyer to satisfy Rule 5.1(a) include detection and resolution of conflicts of interest, good calendar practices relating to deadlines, client trust account management, and supervision of inexperienced lawyers.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_3" id="fn-3">3</a></sup></span> In an office without an express management hierarchy, other measures may be required, such as &#x201C;informal supervision and periodic review of compliance with the required systems.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_4" id="fn-4">4</a></sup></span> Internal office continuing legal education programs also can help a supervisory lawyer satisfy his or her responsibility under Rule 5.1(a).<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_5" id="fn-5">5</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent">Evaluate whether this lawyer may be subject to discipline for her law firm management under Rule 5.1(a):</p>
<p class="image-exeL"><img src="../Casebook/images/exe.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="example"><span class="bolda">Example.</span> Lawyer Harris was the managing partner in a ten-lawyer boutique firm. The firm handled real estate and other civil matters. Lawyer Hendricks was a new associate in Harris&#x2019; firm. Hendricks graduated from law school just a few months earlier. From day one, although Harris did not personally supervise Hendricks&#x2019; work, Harris was difficult as a firm boss, snapping at Hendricks critically over the most minor of issues. At the same time, Harris gave Hendricks a lot of independent responsibility: Hendricks was responsible for creating an executing his own fee agreements, and concerning client trust accounts, Harris told Hendricks, &#x201C;You took PR in law school. I assume you are not an idiot. Figure it out!&#x201D; Hendricks made some mistakes along the way, but ultimately no client was harmed by Hendricks&#x2019; growing pains in the firm. Did Harris violate Rule 5.1(a)?</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page202" class="pagebreak">202</div>
<div class="ana">
<p class="analysis"><span class="bolda">Analysis.</span> Harris likely violated Rule 5.1(a). As the managing lawyer in the firm, Harris was personally responsible for making reasonable efforts to establish measures for reasonably ensuring that all lawyers in the firm did not violate the Rules of Professional Conduct. As a manager, the fact that Harris did not personally supervise Hendricks&#x2019; work did not relieve Harris of this responsibility.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_6" id="fn-6">6</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Because Harris&#x2019; firm handled private practice civil matters, fee agreements and client trust accounts would be a routine part of the firm&#x2019;s practice. Harris needed to establish reasonable policies and procedures for ensuring that these matters were handled properly under the Rules of Professional Conduct.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_7" id="fn-7">7</a></sup></span> &#x201C;Figure it out&#x201D; is not a reasonable policy or procedure for managing such important aspects of a firm&#x2019;s practice.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_8" id="fn-8">8</a></sup></span> However, Harris&#x2019; poor temperament as a boss is likely not a violation of the Rule. Unless Harris&#x2019; bad boss temperament interfered with Harris&#x2019; ability to practice ethically, this issue would remain a question solely of the kind of business Harris wished to run and whether her behavior might lose talented associates or even clients. But Harris&#x2019; failure to implement reasonable measures to ensure reasonable fee agreements and proper handling of client property turned Harris from a bad boss into an unethical boss.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The fact that Hendricks did not harm any clients did not relieve Harris of running such a shoddy operation. Rule 5.1(a) does not subject a supervisory lawyer to discipline for the misconduct of another lawyer. Rule 5.1(a) imposes an independent management duty on supervisory lawyers that Harris failed to satisfy, regardless of whether Hendricks himself violated the Rules of Professional Conduct or whether the firm might be liable to anyone.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_9" id="fn-9">9</a></sup></span></p>

<h4 class="secsub" id="s2-52"><span class="bold">2.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Direct Supervision</span></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 5.1(b) establishes the responsibility of a lawyer who directly supervises another lawyer:</p>
<div class="blue">
<h3 class="sectiona" id="rs1-44"><img src="../Casebook/images/p200.jpg" alt="Image" /></h3>
<p class="box_h"><span class="bold">Responsibility of Partners, Managers, and Supervisory Lawyers</span></p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(b)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;A lawyer having direct supervisory responsibility over another lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the other lawyer conforms to the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 5.1(b) governs circumstances where a lawyer directly supervises another lawyer. In this circumstance, the supervisory lawyer must make reasonable efforts to ensure the other lawyer&#x2019;s conduct complies with the Rules of Professional Conduct. Again, the supervisory lawyer in this instance is not vicariously liable for the misconduct of the subordinate lawyer.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_10" id="fn-10">10</a></sup></span> Rather, the supervisory lawyer is subject to discipline for providing unreasonable training or supervision to enable the subordinate lawyer to practice ethically. The subordinate lawyer&#x2019;s violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct, however, can be evidence of the supervisory lawyer&#x2019;s failure under Rule 5.1(b).<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_11" id="fn-11">11</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Many firms will provide formal or informal lawyer mentors to less experienced lawyers in the firm. This kind of mentoring role can be valuable and rewarding to both lawyers. For the mentoring lawyer, however, if that role involves any direct supervision of the other lawyer&#x2019;s representation of clients, the supervising lawyer needs to ensure that he or she has the knowledge and skill competently to supervise another lawyer and thoroughly prepares for that role.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_12" id="fn-12">12</a></sup></span> As many supervising lawyers learn quickly, being an effective lawyer in your practice area is a different matter than being a good teacher and supervisor to another lawyer, even in that same practice area.</p>

<h4 class="secsub" id="s2-53"><span class="bold">3.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Vicarious Supervisory Liability</span></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 5.1(c) determines when a supervisory lawyer will be responsible for the misconduct of another lawyer:</p>
<div class="blue">
<h3 class="sectiona" id="rs1-45"><img src="../Casebook/images/p200.jpg" alt="Image" /></h3>
<p class="box_h"><span class="bold">Responsibility of Partners, Managers, and Supervisory Lawyers</span></p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(c)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;A lawyer shall be responsible for another lawyer&#x2019;s violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct if:</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(1)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;the lawyer orders or, with knowledge of the specific conduct, ratifies the conduct involved; or</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth1"><span class="bold">(2)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;the lawyer is a partner or has comparable managerial authority in the law firm in which the other lawyer practices, or has direct supervisory authority over the other lawyer, and knows of the conduct at a time when its consequences can be avoided or mitigated but fails to take reasonable remedial action.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">Unlike Rules 5.1(a) and 5.1(b), Rule 5.1(c) does create a type of vicarious liability. As the comments make clear, &#x201C;[p]aragraph (c) expresses a general principle of personal responsibility for acts of another.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_13" id="fn-13">13</a></sup></span> This part of the Rule divides personal responsibility for the acts of another lawyer into two theories: (1) a lawyer in any position who orders or knowingly ratifies another lawyer&#x2019;s misconduct; and (2) a supervisory lawyer who knows of another lawyer&#x2019;s misconduct and could fix it, but chooses not to fix the misconduct. In either circumstance, the lawyer assumes the responsibility of the lawyer engaging in misconduct without personally engaging in that misconduct.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_14" id="fn-14">14</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Consider whether this lawyer may be subject to discipline under Rule 5.1(c):</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page205" class="pagebreak">205</div>
<p class="image-exeL"><img src="../Casebook/images/exe.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="example"><span class="bolda">Example.</span> Lawyer Lumbergh was a partner in a law firm in which lawyer Gibbons practiced. Gibbons knowingly misrepresented material facts to opposing counsel during negotiations in a matter that Lumbergh&#x2019;s firm was handling.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_15" id="fn-15">15</a></sup></span> Lumbergh heard Gibbons bragging to a staff person in the hallway about his material misrepresentation and how he &#x201C;got one over&#x201D; on opposing counsel. Lumbergh thought he was too busy to get involved in Gibbons&#x2019; conduct. &#x201C;Gibbons will pay his own price if he&#x2019;s violating the rules,&#x201D; Lumbergh concluded. Was Lumbergh personally responsible for Gibbons&#x2019; misrepresentation to opposing counsel?</p>
<div class="ana">
<p class="analysis"><span class="bolda">Analysis.</span> Lumbergh may be subject to discipline for Gibbons&#x2019; misconduct. Generally, &#x201C;[a] lawyer does not have disciplinary liability for the conduct of a partner, associate or subordinate.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_16" id="fn-16">16</a></sup></span> But, Rule 5.1(c) could make Lumbergh personally responsible. Lumbergh did not order or ratify Gibbons&#x2019; misconduct, as would be covered by Rule 5.1(c)(1), nor did Lumbergh appear to supervise Gibbons directly. Lumbergh, however, knew of the misconduct and was a partner in the firm. As the comments indicate concerning subsection (c)(2), &#x201C;[p]artners and lawyers with comparable managerial authority have at least indirect responsibility for all work being done by the firm.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_17" id="fn-17">17</a></sup></span> Lumbergh thus had a responsibility to act on Gibbons&#x2019; misconduct, and he could not treat Gibbons&#x2019; misconduct as a matter personal only to Gibbons.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The question thus would become whether Lumbergh could have taken reasonable remedial action to avoid or mitigate the consequences of Gibbons&#x2019; misconduct. The problem does not reveal the nature of the misrepresentation or its impact on the opposing party. But, the Rule suggests a sound course of action: &#x201C;Appropriate remedial action by a partner or managing lawyer would depend on the immediacy of that lawyer&#x2019;s involvement and the seriousness of the misconduct &#x2026; . Thus, if a supervising lawyer knows that a subordinate misrepresented a matter to an opposing party in negotiation, the supervisor as well as the subordinate has a duty to correct the resulting misapprehension.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_18" id="fn-18">18</a></sup></span></p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">In the end, Rule 5.1 does not require or assure that every lawyer will be a good boss. On the contrary, as Rule 5.4&#x2019;s prohibition on non-lawyer ownership or management <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page206" class="pagebreak">206</span>of law firms will demonstrate in another chapter, law firms sometimes lack the business expertise that other professions can offer&#x2014;lawyers are not always well-trained as business managers. But, Rule 5.1 requires lawyers who run law firms or supervise lawyers to learn their business model well enough to ensure that the other lawyers in the firm conform to the Rules of Professional Conduct. And, in what should be no surprise, a lawyer who orders or ratifies or who as a supervisory lawyer fails to correct the misconduct of another lawyer owns that misconduct as his or her own violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>
<div class="quick1">
<p class="quick" id="qs1-19"><span class="bold">Quick Summary</span></p>
<p class="fold-L1"><img src="../Casebook/images/fold1.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="noindent1"><span class="bold">Rule 5.1</span> makes it clear that lawyers can be responsible not only for their own ethics but also for the ethics of lawyers whom they supervise. A supervisory lawyer is subject to discipline if the supervisory lawyer does not reasonably ensure that subordinate lawyers adhere to the Rules of Professional Conduct or if the supervisory lawyer directly supervises another lawyer without making reasonable efforts to ensure compliance with the Rules of Professional Conduct. Moreover, a supervisory lawyer is personally responsible for a subordinate lawyer&#x2019;s misconduct if the supervisory lawyer orders or ratifies the misconduct or knows of the subordinate lawyer&#x2019;s misconduct and fails to take timely remedial action.</p>
