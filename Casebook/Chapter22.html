<p class="image-lensL"><img src="../Casebook/images/ltt.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="noindent1">You have already learned that a lawyer is a &#x201C;public citizen having special responsibility for the quality of justice.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_1" id="fn-1">1</a></sup></span> This special responsibility means that a lawyer should &#x201C;devote professional time and resources &#x2026; to ensure equal access to our system of justice for all those who because of economic or social barriers cannot afford or secure legal counsel.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_2" id="fn-2">2</a></sup></span> The duties embedded in this responsibility respond to what often is termed the &#x201C;access to justice crisis.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="clear"></p>
<p class="noindent1">The access to justice crisis is rooted in the financial inability of a substantial number of individuals to access the necessary resources to participate meaningfully and equally in our civil system of justice.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_3" id="fn-3">3</a></sup></span> Because of the legal knowledge and training <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page222" class="pagebreak">222</span>often needed to navigate our civil justice system, these necessary resources typically include the assistance of a licensed legal practitioner.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_4" id="fn-4">4</a></sup></span> Yet, &#x201C;[a]ccording to most estimates, about four-fifths of the civil legal needs of the poor &#x2026; remain unmet.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_5" id="fn-5">5</a></sup></span> The access to justice crisis, moreover, extends beyond poor and low-income individuals: &#x201C;two- to three-fifths of the needs of middle-income individuals&#x201D; also remain unfulfilled.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_6" id="fn-6">6</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">The Rules of Professional Conduct look to lawyers to fill some of this access-to-justice gap.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_7" id="fn-7">7</a></sup></span> As a &#x201C;public citizen,&#x201D; lawyers already have a special responsibility for ensuring that our system of justice secures access to justice for individuals, regardless of financial means.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_8" id="fn-8">8</a></sup></span> Building on this public citizen responsibility, Rule 6.1 codifies a lawyer&#x2019;s responsibility regularly to provide <span class="italic">pro bono</span> services&#x2014;legal services to persons of limited means without expectation of a fee.</p>
<h3 class="secmain" id="r1-20"><span class="bold">The Rule</span></h3>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 6.1 begins by expressing a lawyer&#x2019;s responsibility to provide <span class="italic">pro bono</span> services.</p>
<h4 class="secsub" id="s2-55"><span class="bold">1.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Pro Bono Responsibility</span></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 6.1 establishes the responsibility of every lawyer to provide &#x201C;voluntary&#x201D; <span class="italic">pro bono</span> services:</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page223" class="pagebreak">223</div>
<div class="blue">
<h3 class="sectiona" id="rs1-48"><img src="../Casebook/images/p223.jpg" alt="Image" /></h3>
<p class="box_h"><span class="bold">Voluntary Pro Bono Publico Service</span></p>
<p class="box-noindent">A lawyer should render public interest legal service. A lawyer may discharge this responsibility by providing professional services at no fee or a reduced fee to persons of limited means or to public service or charitable groups or organizations, by service in activities for improving the law, the legal system or the legal profession, and by financial support for organizations that provide legal services to persons of limited means.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">The first question you should raise from Rule 6.1 is whether the Rule imposes an enforceable <span class="italic">duty</span> on lawyers to perform <span class="italic">pro bono</span> services. The language of the Rule suggests that the answer is yes.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_9" id="fn-9">9</a></sup></span> Further, mandatory <span class="italic">pro bono</span> would be consistent with the objective of the Rule to improve access to justice. Yet, the answer largely is no; although this Rule does establish a professional responsibility applicable to every lawyer, the comments make clear that enforcement of the Rule &#x201C;is not intended to be enforced through disciplinary process.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_10" id="fn-10">10</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">The second question you should ask is how many hours of <span class="italic">pro bono</span> service should be performed a year. While the Rules of Professional Conduct do not specify how many hours of <span class="italic">pro bono</span> service are expected, other states do. For example, Washington mandates that &#x201C;a lawyer should aspire to render at least (30) hours of <span class="italic">pro bono</span> publico legal services per year.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_11" id="fn-11">11</a></sup></span> The A.B.A. Model Rules, by contrast, list fifty hours of <span class="italic">pro bono</span> service as the expected norm.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_12" id="fn-12">12</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">The resulting dichotomy of an unenforceable professional responsibility reflects major compromises surrounding <span class="italic">pro bono</span> services as this Rule developed.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_13" id="fn-13">13</a></sup></span> Lawyers have objected to <span class="italic">pro bono</span> services because it uniquely burdens lawyers with forced charity, it generates concerns about competent representation, it is impractical to expect busy lawyers to perform this service every year, and it is problematic to monitor this activity effectively for discipline.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_14" id="fn-14">14</a></sup></span> Supporters of <span class="italic">pro bono</span> services, by contrast, have argued that a <span class="italic">pro bono</span> duty is appropriate because of lawyers&#x2019; unique monopoly over legal services, and it fills critical legal needs, offers public <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page224" class="pagebreak">224</span>relations and business opportunities, attracts talented lawyers, and enhances lawyers&#x2019; emotional well-being within an often stressful profession.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_15" id="fn-15">15</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">States largely have followed the Rules&#x2019; compromise and do not discipline lawyers for failing to provide <span class="italic">pro bono</span> services. Some states, however, have employed other measures to incentivize <span class="italic">pro bono</span> services. For example, New York State recently adopted a rule requiring that Bar <span class="italic">applicants</span> perform fifty hours of <span class="italic">pro bono</span> service as a condition to being admitted.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_16" id="fn-16">16</a></sup></span> Other states have adopted mandatory <span class="italic">pro bono reportin</span>g requirements, where a lawyer can be disciplined for failing to report to the Bar on how much <span class="italic">pro bono</span> service he or she performed in that reporting cycle.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_17" id="fn-17">17</a></sup></span> States also publicly recognize lawyers who perform high levels of <span class="italic">pro bono</span> service<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_18" id="fn-18">18</a></sup></span> and provide business incentives in exchange for <span class="italic">pro bono</span> service, such as referrals and free or reduced-cost continuing legal education.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_19" id="fn-19">19</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Despite these measures, <span class="italic">pro bono</span> service remains effectively voluntary, and thus, &#x201C;ultimately rests upon the individual lawyer.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_20" id="fn-20">20</a></sup></span> Lawyers, however, often do not practice only as individuals, but practice in a firm environment, where billable hours and top-down business pressures may limit the ability of individuals lawyers to fulfill this responsibility. Some versions of the Rules of Professional Conduct recognize this reality and note that &#x201C;[l]aw firms should act reasonably to enable and encourage all lawyers in the firm to provide the <span class="italic">pro bono</span> legal services called <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page225" class="pagebreak">225</span>for by this Rule.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_21" id="fn-21">21</a></sup></span> Moreover, these Rules acknowledge that &#x201C;at times it may be more feasible to satisfy the <span class="italic">pro bono</span> responsibility collectively, as by a firm&#x2019;s aggregate <span class="italic">pro bono</span> activities.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_22" id="fn-22">22</a></sup></span> Nevertheless, like lawyers, law firms are not subject to disciplinary process for failing in their <span class="italic">pro bono</span> responsibilities.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_23" id="fn-23">23</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">One universal norm of <span class="italic">pro bono</span> service is that to constitute <span class="italic">pro bono</span>, legal work must be provided &#x201C;without fee or at a substantially reduced fee.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_24" id="fn-24">24</a></sup></span> This standard may mean that &#x201C;the intent of the lawyer to render free legal services is essential.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_25" id="fn-25">25</a></sup></span> As a result, lawyers cannot use <span class="italic">pro bono</span> as a backup to the deadbeat client: &#x201C;services rendered cannot be considered <span class="italic">pro bono</span> if an anticipated fee is uncollected.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_26" id="fn-26">26</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent">Consider whether this lawyer honored her <span class="italic">pro bono</span> responsibilities under Model Rule 6.1:</p>
<p class="image-exeL"><img src="../Casebook/images/exe.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="example"><span class="bolda">Example.</span> Lawyer Agenda practiced at a large private law firm in the firm&#x2019;s litigation department. Agenda was very experienced and billed several hundred dollars an hour for her services. Agenda, however, was interested in public law issues, and welcomed opportunities to represent parties she favored in civil rights litigation. Recently, Agenda won a major case in which she represented Angry Parents, a coalition of parents who opposed diversity policies adopted by the local school board. Agenda did not request or expect a fee when she agreed to represent Angry Parents. But, when Agenda won the case, she sought attorney&#x2019;s fees, which this jurisdiction authorized. Agenda sought fees at her market rates, which over the life of the case totaled $1.8 million dollars. The school board claimed that this award would exceed its insurance policy coverage and drain its operating budget. Agenda responded, &#x201C;Too bad. Don&#x2019;t violate the Constitution if you don&#x2019;t want to pay the cost of litigation against you.&#x201D; At the same time, Agenda reported her time representing Angry Parents to her State Bar as <span class="italic">pro bono</span> service, and requested that she be listed in the Bar&#x2019;s &#x201C;<span class="italic">Pro Bono</span> Honor Roll&#x201D; Bulletin. Agenda planned to market this Bulletin to current and prospective clients who express interest in public service. May Agenda properly claim that she performed <span class="italic">pro bono</span> service in representing Angry Parents?</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page226" class="pagebreak">226</div>
<div class="ana">
<p class="analysis"><span class="bolda">Analysis.</span> Agenda agreed to represent Angry Parents without fee or expectation of fee, so she began the case in position properly to claim <span class="italic">pro bono</span> service to her State Bar.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_27" id="fn-27">27</a></sup></span> Furthermore, the Rules of Professional Conduct provide that &#x201C;the award of statutory attorney&#x2019;s fees in a case originally accepted as <span class="italic">pro bono</span> would not disqualify such services from inclusion under this section.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_28" id="fn-28">28</a></sup></span> Therefore, the fact alone that Agenda was paid attorney&#x2019;s fee after winning the case would not prevent her from claiming this work as <span class="italic">pro bono</span> service to her State Bar.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 6.1, however, further encourages lawyers in this circumstance &#x201C;to contribute an appropriate portion of such fees to organizations or projects that benefit persons of limited means.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_29" id="fn-29">29</a></sup></span> This comment does not require this action as a condition to claiming <span class="italic">pro bono</span> service, so Agenda still might be able to keep the attorney&#x2019;s fees and claim <span class="italic">pro bono</span> service. Yet, the same comment does not approve of any attorney&#x2019;s fees as consistent with <span class="italic">pro bono</span> service&#x2014;just that attorney&#x2019;s fees do not disqualify the lawyer from claiming <span class="italic">pro bono</span> service. Agenda billed her full market rate at several hundred dollars an hour. Recent high-profile cases have raised the question of whether lawyers who bill large firm market rates in claiming attorney&#x2019;s fees still may claim that work as <span class="italic">pro bono</span> service, because these market rates so exceed any conception of <span class="italic">pro bono</span> service.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_30" id="fn-30">30</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Agenda accordingly should be cautious about claiming this work as <span class="italic">pro bono</span> service to her State Bar: if she claimed market rates for representing Angry Parents, Agenda arguably did not fulfill the spirit, if not the letter, of Model Rule 6.1. Agenda could avoid this dilemma by donating her profit to an appropriate cause, as some firms in this position have done.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_31" id="fn-31">31</a></sup></span> At a minimum, Agenda should be careful about marketing this work as <span class="italic">pro bono</span> to current or prospective clients who express interest in public service, as they could be misled by this claim if Agenda in fact pocketed market rates.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_32" id="fn-32">32</a></sup></span></p>

<h4 class="secsub" id="s2-56"><span class="bold">2.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Pro Bono Activities</span></h4>
<p class="noindent1">In addition to defining an unenforceable <span class="italic">pro bono</span> responsibility, Rule 6.1 identifies the types of activities that can satisfy this responsibility.</p>
<div class="blue">
<h3 class="sectiona" id="rs1-49"><img src="../Casebook/images/p223.jpg" alt="Image" /></h3>
<p class="box_h"><span class="bold">Voluntary Pro Bono Publico Service</span></p>
<p class="box-noindent">A lawyer may discharge this responsibility by providing professional services at no fee or a reduced fee to persons of limited means or to public service or charitable groups or organizations, by service in activities for improving the law, the legal system or the legal profession, and by financial support for organizations that provide legal services to persons of limited means.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 6.1 is detailed, but expresses a simple point: a lawyer has a lot of flexibility in how and for whom the lawyer can perform <span class="italic">pro bono</span> services.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_33" id="fn-33">33</a></sup></span> Ultimately, &#x201C;providing legal services for those unable to pay&#x201D; is prioritized.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_34" id="fn-34">34</a></sup></span> But a variety of factors may limit a lawyer&#x2019;s ability to satisfy <span class="italic">pro bono</span> responsibility solely through this means. In that instance, the rest of the Rule indicates other ways for lawyers to satisfy their responsibility.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_35" id="fn-35">35</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 6.1 therefore establishes an aspirational rule: lawyers have a professional responsibility to provide <span class="italic">pro bono</span> services, but are not subject to disciplinary process for failing in that responsibility. Nevertheless, many state bars and courts work hard to help lawyers find realistic and fulfilling ways to serve persons in need. As &#x201C;public citizen,&#x201D; you should take that responsibility seriously and look for and respond to these opportunities for public service.</p>

<p class="fn_list1"><span class="bold"><a href="#fn-20" id="fn_20">20</a></span>&#xA0;&#xA0;DLRPC Rule 6.1, comment 3. One potential exception arises when a court seeks to appoint counsel. Lawyers may not seek to avoid appointment by a tribunal to represent a person except for good cause. <span class="italic">See</span> Model Rule 6.2. The propriety of a judicial appointment that will not be compensated raises difficult questions in addition to the question of whether the Bar may establish <span class="italic">pro bono</span> responsibilities as a condition of licensure. The U.S. Supreme Court has not ruled on whether an uncompensated judicial appointment would violate the Constitution. <span class="italic">Cf. Mallard v. U.S. Dist. Court for the Southern Dist. of Iowa</span>, 490 U.S. 296 (1989) (concluding as a matter of statutory interpretation that federal statute did not authorize judicial appointment in this circumstance). For varied judicial views on whether judges properly can appoint lawyers to work without pay, <span class="italic">see Madden v. Township of Delran</span>, 601 A.2d 211 (N.J. 1992) (rejecting constitutional arguments against uncompensated appointment); <span class="italic">Cunningham v. Sup. Ct. of Ventura County</span>, 222 Cal.Rptr. 854 (Cal. App. 1986) (finding that uncompensated judicial appointments violated Fifth and Thirteenth Amendments); <span class="italic">Bothwell v. Republic Tobacco Co.</span>, 912 F. Supp. 1221 (D. Neb. 1995) (finding judicial authority, but only if litigant lacked representation due to indigency and not due to the marketability of the claim).</p>
