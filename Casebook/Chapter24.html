<h3 class="secmain" id="int1-24"><span class="bold">Introduction</span></h3>
<p class="image-lensL"><img src="../Casebook/images/ltt.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="noindent1">Professionals who are not in the practice of law are typically allowed to enter into agreements that restrict the right of the professional to compete if the restriction is reasonable. These agreements are often referred to as &#x201C;covenants not to compete.&#x201D; The rule for lawyers, however, is actually the opposite. Rule 5.6(a)<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_1" id="fn-1">1</a></sup></span> prohibits a lawyer from participating in any &#x201C;partnership, shareholders, operating, employment, or other similar type of agreement&#x201D; that <span class="italic">restricts</span> a lawyer&#x2019;s right to practice. A lawyer who is a party to such an agreement is subject to discipline. Further, the agreement itself may be unenforceable.</p>
<p class="clear"></p>
<p class="noindent1">What is the rationale for the rule? The rationale seems to be a mixture of concern for lawyers and concern for clients. The concern for lawyers is that a restrictive agreement limits a lawyer&#x2019;s freedom to practice law. The concern for clients is that these agreements tend to limit a client&#x2019;s ability to have the attorney of their choice. As explained by the American Bar Association (A.B.A.) in a formal opinion:</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page244" class="pagebreak">244</div>
<p class="blockquote">The rationale of Model Rule 5.6 is clear. First, permitting such agreements restricts the access of the public to lawyers who, by virtue of their background and experience, might be the very best available talent to represent these individuals. Second, the use of such agreements may provide clients with rewards that bear less relationship to the merits of their claims than they do to the desire of the defendant to &#x201C;buy off&#x201D; plaintiff&#x2019;s counsel. Third, the offering of such restrictive agreements places the plaintiff&#x2019;s lawyer in a situation where there is conflict between the interests of present clients and those of potential future clients. While the &#x2026; Rules generally require that the client&#x2019;s interests be put first, forcing a lawyer to give up future representations may be asking too much, particularly in light of the strong countervailing policy favoring the public&#x2019;s unfettered choice of counsel.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_2" id="fn-2">2</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Courts generally do not enforce agreements restricting lawyers&#x2019; right to practice because these agreements are contrary to the rules of professional responsibility for lawyers and thus contradict public policy. Further, courts are virtually unanimous in their disapproval of an agreement that may not directly restrict competition per se but does so indirectly by imposing financial disincentives or penalties for competition. For example, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in <span class="italic">Einstein v. David G. Conlin</span>,<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_3" id="fn-3">3</a></sup></span> refused to enforce a contract that required departing lawyers to pay a share of the fees to the former firm if the fees related to past or current clients of the former firm. A few courts have enforced contracts with financial disincentives to compete. These courts appear to evaluate the restrictions on competition using a reasonableness standard, just as they do with restrictions on non-lawyers.</p>
<h3 class="secmain" id="r1-22"><span class="bold">The Rule</span></h3>
<p class="noindent1">Model Rule 5.6(a) states that a lawyer cannot enter into an agreement that restricts the lawyer&#x2019;s right to practice law.</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page245" class="pagebreak">245</div>

<p class="box_h"><span class="bold">Restrictions on Right to Practice</span></p>
<p class="box-noindent">A lawyer shall not participate in offering or making:</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(a)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;a partnership, shareholders, operating, employment, or other similar type of agreement that restricts the right of a lawyer to practice after termination of the relationship, except an agreement concerning benefits upon retirement; or &#x2026;</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">Note that there is an explicit exception within 5.6(a): &#x201C;except an agreement concerning benefits upon retirement &#x2026; .&#x201D; Rule 5.6 generally prohibits restrictions on the lawyer&#x2019;s right to practice. However, if the restriction is part of an agreement regarding retirement benefits, the restriction is permissible. This exception will be discussed more fully in the paragraphs below.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 5.6 prohibits a lawyer from either requiring or accepting an employment contract restricting the lawyer&#x2019;s right to practice law after termination of the employment relationship. Such restrictive covenants violate the discipline rules even if they are limited to a stated period and geographic area.</p>
<p class="noindent1">For example, a lawyer may not accept or propose a restriction in an employment agreement prohibiting a lawyer for a corporation from representing anyone in any future action against the corporation. The former lawyer for the corporation could not ethically engage in subsequent adverse representation that is substantially related to the prior representation.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_4" id="fn-4">4</a></sup></span> To go beyond that and prohibit all future adverse representation, including matters that are unrelated, violates Rule 5.6(a).<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_5" id="fn-5">5</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Further, most courts will not enforce a restrictive covenant that violates this rule. For example, in <span class="italic">Stevens v. Rooks Pitts &amp; Poust</span>,<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_6" id="fn-6">6</a></sup></span> the court held that a law firm cannot impose a financial penalty on a lawyer that goes into effect if the lawyer leaves the law firm and then competes with it, because that penalty is a form of <span class="italic">restriction</span>, which Rule 5.6 prohibits.</p>
<p class="noindent1">One notable variation is the State of California. The California Supreme Court in <span class="italic">Howard v. Babcock</span>,<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_7" id="fn-7">7</a></sup></span> concluded that it should treat law firms <span class="italic">no differently</span> from <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page246" class="pagebreak">246</span>other business partnerships, such as accountants&#x2019; and doctors&#x2019; practices. Because California permits these other businesses to enter into agreements restricting competition under its business and professions code, California was not willing to treat lawyers differently. The court held that an agreement among a law firm&#x2019;s partners imposing reasonable costs on departing partners who compete with the law firm in limited geographical areas is enforceable.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_8" id="fn-8">8</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Justice Kennard, in <span class="italic">Howard,</span> strongly dissented to the majority. The majority was implementing the restrictive covenant even though California&#x2019;s ethics rules, like Delaware&#x2019;s rules, prohibited lawyers &#x201C;from entering into agreements that &#x2018;restrict&#x2019; their right to practice law after leaving a firm.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_9" id="fn-9">9</a></sup></span> But the majority still held&#x2014;contrary to the unambiguous language of the rule&#x2014;that the rule did not bar law firms from entering into competition agreements with their attorneys if such agreements are &#x2018;reasonable.&#x2019; So the California courts, unlike most states, <span class="italic">will</span> enforce restrictive covenants that the courts own rules prohibit.</p>
<h4 class="secsub" id="s2-61"><span class="bold">1.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;The Retirement Exception</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">As mentioned above, Rule 5.6(a) has an exception. If the restriction on the practice of law is part of an agreement regarding retirement benefits, the restriction is permissible. The policy is that a retiring lawyer would not be available for clients anyway, so restricting that lawyer&#x2019;s right to practice law would have no practical effect on the lawyer or on the client populace. Consider the following real-life example:</p>
<p class="image-exeL"><img src="../Casebook/images/exe.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="example"><span class="bolda">Example.</span> Neumann was a partner in ABC law firm but decided to leave and join Fancy law firm.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_10" id="fn-10">10</a></sup></span> When Neumann originally joined the ABC law firm, he signed a partnership agreement providing that partners who left the firm to engage in the private practice of law would receive their capital contribution and share of the net partnership profits back as of their separation date, but <span class="italic">would not</span> be entitled to what the agreement termed the &#x201C;Additional Amount&#x201D; that was linked to the productivity of the partner over a period of years preceding his or her withdrawal. The ABC law firm argued that the &#x201C;Additional Amount&#x201D; was meant to be given to partners who permanently retired from the <span class="italic">practice of law</span> and not given to those who simply chose to &#x201C;retire&#x201D; from working at ABC law firm. Did the partnership agreement violate Rule 5.6(a)?</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page247" class="pagebreak">247</div>
<div class="ana">
<p class="analysis"><span class="bolda">Analysis.</span> The agreement did <span class="italic">not</span> violate Rule 5.6(a). The question turned on whether &#x201C;retirement&#x201D; meant simply withdrawal from the firm or withdrawal from the practice of law. The court found that the agreement fell within the exception under 5.6(a) for benefits upon retirement. Because the &#x201C;Additional Amount&#x201D; came entirely from firm profits <span class="italic">after</span> a partner withdrew from the firm, it was not a true restriction on Neumann&#x2019;s right to go to his new law firm. The court noted that because it was only future revenues that Neumann would no longer be entitled to receive, and because Neumann was choosing to go to another firm, the agreement was fair given that the law firm&#x2019;s profits would indeed decrease without his work. The decision quoted a leading treatise: &#x201C;Rule 5.6(a) is designed, in part, to protect lawyers, particularly young lawyers, from bargaining away their right to open their own offices after they end an association with a firm or other legal employer. It also protects future clients against having only a restricted pool of attorneys from which to choose.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_11" id="fn-11">11</a></sup></span></p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">Under this exception in Rule 5.6(a), the real issue regarding retirement benefits is how one determines whether an agreement or a provision within that agreement is &#x201C;concerning benefits upon retirement&#x201D; or not. Under A.B.A. Formal Opinion 06&#x2013;444 (2006), the committee clarified that an agreement does <span class="italic">not</span> relate to retirement benefits and, thus, does not fit within the exception, <span class="italic">unless the provision affects benefits available only to lawyers retiring from the practice of law.</span> Second, to be considered a provision relating to retirement benefits, the provision cannot <span class="italic">penalize</span> the lawyer by taking away funds already earned. Other indicators that are not independently dispositive of a retirement benefit arrangement include benefit calculation formulas, provisions for benefits to increase as years of service increase, and provisions that provide for the payment of amounts for the remaining lifetime of the lawyer. These types of clauses fit within the exception to Rule 5.6(a)&#x2014;meaning that these types of agreements may be allowed.</p>
<h4 class="secsub" id="s2-62"><span class="bold">2.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Restrictions in Connection with a Settlement</span></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 5.6(b) prohibits a lawyer from entering into, offering, or making any agreement that is part of a settlement of a client&#x2019;s matter if that agreement also restricts the lawyer&#x2019;s right to practice after the settlement. For example, Lisa Lawyer represents Cindy Client in a products liability action against Corporation. Lisa does a really good job developing Cindy&#x2019;s case. As a result, Corporation would like to settle for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page248" class="pagebreak">248</span>a reasonable amount with Cindy. Corporation would also like to <span class="italic">prevent</span> Lisa from representing other plaintiffs with similar claims against it because Corporation fears Lisa could be particularly effective as a lawyer in handling similar claims against it. Suppose Corporation offers a very respectable settlement amount to Cindy but the offer includes the requirement that <span class="italic">Lisa not represent clients with similar claims against Corporation.</span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Under Rule 5.6(b), this provision that Lisa not represent clients against Corporation is prohibited. Why? This type of offer creates a conflict of interest between the lawyer, Lisa, and her client, Cindy. Here is the language of subsection (b):</p>
<div class="blue">
<h3 class="sectiona" id="rs1-55"><img src="../Casebook/images/p234.jpg" alt="Image" /></h3>
<p class="box_h"><span class="bold">Restrictions on Right to Practice</span></p>
<p class="box-noindent">A lawyer shall not participate in offering or making:</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(a)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#x2026;</p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(b)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;an agreement in which a restriction on the lawyer&#x2019;s right to practice is part of the settlement of a client controversy.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 5.6(b) makes it clear that lawyers may not place restrictions on their practice of law as part of the settlement of a client&#x2019;s controversy&#x2014;even if it seems to benefit the current client. Clients always have a right to discharge their lawyers at any time and hire new counsel, and a lawyer can always turn down a prospective client. But if lawyers were forced to (or were allowed to force another lawyer to) agree to restrictive covenants in settlement agreements, then these covenants would impose restraints, not only on the lawyer&#x2019;s professional autonomy, but also on the new client&#x2019;s freedom to choose a lawyer.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 5.6(b) is based upon two main rationales: lawyer freedom and client freedom. Notwithstanding these rationales, a lawyer may not accept or be part of a settlement agreement that would limit the ability of the lawyer to accept future clients. For example, if the defendant wanted the plaintiff (in a products liability suit) to settle on the condition that plaintiff&#x2019;s lawyer agree <span class="italic">not</span> to sue defendant in the future, the plaintiff may well agree, thinking &#x201C;it&#x2019;s not my problem&#x2014;I want to settle!&#x201D; However, that settlement could substantially damage plaintiff&#x2019;s lawyer, who would not be able to sue defendant in the future. And it would also put the interests of the plaintiff in conflict with the interest of her lawyer. Hence, Rule <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page249" class="pagebreak">249</span>5.6(b) instructs the lawyers on both sides of any controversy that they may not agree to such a settlement.</p>
<p class="noindent1">However, there has been some criticism of Rule 5.6(b). For example, in <span class="italic">Feldman</span> <span class="italic">v. Minar</span>s,<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_12" id="fn-12">12</a></sup></span> the New York court was faced with the issue of whether to enforce an agreement entered into as part of a settlement of the claims of clients.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In that agreement, the lawyers representing certain plaintiffs agreed not to &#x201C;assist or cooperate&#x201D; in the pursuit of claims of other persons against the original defendants. Later, those lawyers did in fact &#x201C;assist or cooperate&#x201D; in future claims and the original defendants sued the attorneys to enforce that clause of the settlement agreement. In response, the attorneys claimed that the agreement should not be enforced because it was contrary to the applicable rules of professional responsibility and, thus, against public policy. The New York court held that the earlier agreement precluded the later representation <span class="italic">even though</span> the lawyers involved with that earlier agreement might be subject to professional discipline. This was an interesting result; the attorneys could be subject to discipline but the court would uphold the agreement nonetheless.</p>
<p class="noindent">What about the following situation? What would you do?</p>
<p class="image-exeL"><img src="../Casebook/images/exe.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="example"><span class="bolda">Example.</span> Senior Partner calls you into her office: &#x201C;Good news, Young Associate! We have settled the new case against the aggressive ABC law firm. Now please go tell our defense team to draft a settlement agreement that settles the case but also ties up that ABC firm tight as a drum. I don&#x2019;t want to see those guys on the other side from us &#x2026; period! Is that clear? Put in the agreement that they can never represent anyone against us ever again, understand?&#x201D;</p>
<p class="example">Your answer: &#x201C;But boss, that&#x2019;s prohibited by the ethics rules.&#x201D; Senior Partner groans. &#x201C;Okay, make the settlement confidential, the documents confidential, hire them as our lawyers &#x2026; I don&#x2019;t care how much extra you need to pay the attorneys, keep them off our backs.&#x201D; What do you do?</p>
<div class="ana">
<p class="analysis"><span class="bolda">Analysis.</span> The first thing Young Associate should do is to review the ethics rules in the state whose law will govern the settlement agreement and counsel&#x2019;s conduct. Remember, the enforceability of the provision is one issue; the ethical propriety of the lawyer&#x2019;s conduct under the governing law is another <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page250" class="pagebreak">250</span>issue. In a settlement agreement, it is unethical for a lawyer to agree <span class="italic">not</span> to represent other persons in connection with settling a claim on behalf of a client. In this case, it is also improper for Young Associate to draft such an agreement on behalf of the client. However, can Young Associate still accomplish at least a <span class="italic">part</span> of what the Senior Partner wants him or her to do? Perhaps. Young Associate <span class="italic">can</span> draft a carefully written settlement agreement that limits disclosure of confidential materials and requires advance notice of potential disclosures. This may have the effect of causing opposing counsel to consider the wisdom of proceeding against your client again. In addition, severability clauses in settlement agreements can be very important and useful to make sure that even if some provisions are stricken, others may survive. While the likelihood of ethical sanctions in such situations is low, these ethical rules are particularly important as they may lead to the undoing of provisions of some settlement agreements&#x2014;which would be very bad for clients.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_13" id="fn-13">13</a></sup></span></p>
</div>
<h4 class="secsub" id="s2-63"><span class="bold">3.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Other Types of Improper Agreements</span></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Other more indirect restrictions on a lawyer&#x2019;s right and ability to practice law also are not in accord with Rule 5.6(b). For example, if Lisa Lawyer agreed, in connection with the settlement of Cindy Client&#x2019;s claim, that Lisa would not disclose or use information gained in the representation but not otherwise protected by the duty of confidentiality owed to Cindy, Lisa would violate Rule 5.6(b). Corporation might offer a deal to Lisa that would, in effect, bar Lisa from representing other clients with similar claims against Corporation. If Lisa could not use the information she had discovered about Corporation, it would be impossible for Lisa to provide competent representation to any other client with a claim against Corporation. The ultimate effect of such an agreement would be a limitation on Lisa&#x2019;s ability to practice law, contrary to the rule prohibiting such limitations.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In Formal Opinion No. 00&#x2013;417, the A.B.A. Standing Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility addressed the application of Rule 5.6(b) to a settlement agreement that prohibited counsel from <span class="italic">using information learned during the existing representation in any future representation</span> against the same opponent. Finding that the restriction was impermissible under Rule 5.6(b), the committee explained that, even though it was not a <span class="italic">direct</span> ban on any future representation, &#x201C;[a]s a practical matter &#x2026; [it] effectively would bar the lawyer from future representations because the lawyer&#x2019;s inability to use certain information may materially <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page251" class="pagebreak">251</span>limit his representation of the future client and, further, may adversely affect that representation.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_14" id="fn-14">14</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">In addition, such a provision would undermine an important policy rationale underlying Rule 5.6(b)&#x2014;by preventing the use of information learned during the prior representation, the provision would restrict the public&#x2019;s access to the services of a lawyer who, &#x201C;by virtue of [his] background and experience, might be the most qualified lawyer available to represent future clients against the same opposing party.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_15" id="fn-15">15</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">In reaching its determination, the committee was careful to distinguish between a restriction against the <span class="italic">use</span> of information learned during the representation and a restriction against the <span class="italic">disclosure</span> of confidential information, such as the terms of the settlement, noting that that latter type of restriction merely comports with the requirements of Rule 1.6 and &#x201C;does not necessarily limit the lawyer&#x2019;s future practice in the manner accomplished by a restriction on the use of information relating to the opposing party.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_16" id="fn-16">16</a></sup></span> And, while acknowledging that Rule 1.9(c) precludes a lawyer from subsequently using information relating to a prior representation,<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_17" id="fn-17">17</a></sup></span> the committee noted that the restraint imposed under that rule does not extend to the subsequent use of information that is not adverse to the interest of the former client or that is publicly known.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_18" id="fn-18">18</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Many jurisdictions agree with the A.B.A. that settlement agreements containing indirect restrictions on the lawyer&#x2019;s right to practice violate those jurisdictions&#x2019; equivalents of Rule 5.6(b). Examples of similar provisions found to constitute unethical restrictions under the rule include those that require counsel to keep confidential public information concerning the case, such as the identity of the defendant, the allegations of the complaint, and the fact of settlement;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_19" id="fn-19">19</a></sup></span> those that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page252" class="pagebreak">252</span>prohibit counsel from disclosing information concerning the business or operations of the opposing party;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_20" id="fn-20">20</a></sup></span> those that require counsel to turn over her work product to opposing counsel;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_21" id="fn-21">21</a></sup></span> and, those that bar counsel from subpoenaing certain records or fact witnesses, or from using certain expert witnesses in future actions against the opponent.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_22" id="fn-22">22</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Another type of agreement that has been held to be improper and unenforceable is an agreement in connection with a settlement of a client&#x2019;s claim that provides for the future employment of the lawyer by the opposing party. Often, this future employment can come in the form of the lawyer being a consultant for Corporation. Corporation might agree to settle with Cindy Client if Lisa Lawyer agrees to be retained by Corporation and become a legal consultant for Corporation. If Lisa agrees to this arrangement, she is more or less agreeing <span class="italic">not</span> to represent other clients on claims against Corporation. Because the effect of the agreement is to limit Lisa&#x2019;s ability to practice law, this is an inappropriate arrangement under Rule 5.6. Courts and discipline authorities see through this type of arrangement and find such agreements both improper and unenforceable.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In its <span class="italic">Ethical Guidelines for Settlement Negotiations</span>, the A.B.A.&#x2019;s Section on Litigation proscribes as unethical settlement provisions in which a plaintiff&#x2019;s attorney agrees to become a consultant for, or be retained as an attorney by, the opponent.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_23" id="fn-23">23</a></sup></span> Such a provision may be regarded as a &#x201C;buy off&#x201D; of plaintiff&#x2019;s attorney, since &#x201C;conflict of interest rules will prevent the plaintiff&#x2019;s lawyer from representing future plaintiffs against the defendant without the defendant&#x2019;s consent.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_24" id="fn-24">24</a></sup></span> Some courts have agreed with this Analysis.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_25" id="fn-25">25</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">In <span class="italic">Adams v. BellSouth Telecomm</span>., <span class="italic">Inc.</span>,<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_26" id="fn-26">26</a></sup></span> for example, a federal district court concurred with the findings of the magistrate that the defendant&#x2019;s counsel violated Florida Bar Rule 4&#x2013;5.6(b) by conditioning settlement of the underlying action on the inclusion of a consulting agreement. Under this agreement, which was not made known to the plaintiffs, counsel for both parties agreed that plaintiffs&#x2019; counsel would be hired as a consult for the defendant upon settlement of the existing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page253" class="pagebreak">253</span>case.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_27" id="fn-27">27</a></sup></span> The agreement further provided that consideration for the consulting arrangement would be taken from the total amount of the settlement.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_28" id="fn-28">28</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">According to the court, the record disclosed that defense counsel aggressively negotiated for inclusion of the consulting arrangement in the settlement. Due to the questionable litigation tactics on the part of plaintiffs&#x2019; counsel, defense counsel &#x201C;sought to create &#x2018;finality&#x2019; for their client by preventing the filing of similar future suits by Plaintiffs&#x2019; counsel.&#x2019; &#x2019;&#x2019;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_29" id="fn-29">29</a></sup></span> Although noting that this motive was neither disreputable nor detrimental to the interests of the defendant,<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_30" id="fn-30">30</a></sup></span> the court held that the consulting agreement constituted a clear practice restriction that violated Rule 4&#x2013;5.6(b) for several public policy reasons: not only was the agreement &#x201C;a payoff to Plaintiffs&#x2019; counsel to make them go away and never come back[,]&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_31" id="fn-31">31</a></sup></span> but it created a direct conflict of interest between plaintiffs&#x2019; counsel and their clients.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_32" id="fn-32">32</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 5.6(b) is not without its critics,<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_33" id="fn-33">33</a></sup></span> and courts have not always been willing to invalidate restrictive settlement agreements that violate the rule.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_34" id="fn-34">34</a></sup></span> Indeed, you can question whether it is consistent with zealous advocacy for your client to forego an advantageous bargaining chip in settlement negotiations to preserve the rights of non-clients who have chosen to sit out the battle on the sidelines. The rule remains, however, and counsel who offer or accept practice restrictions in settlement agreements must examine the extent to which they commit an ethical violation for which disciplinary sanctions may be imposed.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_35" id="fn-35">35</a></sup></span></p>

<p class="noindent1"><span class="bold">Rule 5.6</span> states that a lawyer may not be a party to, offer or participate in making a partnership, employment, or other agreement that also restricts a lawyer&#x2019;s right to practice law unless the restriction relates to retirement benefits. Indirect restrictions such as financial disincentives to practice are improper as well. Most courts find agreements with direct or indirect restrictions on a lawyer&#x2019;s right to practice to be unenforceable because they are contrary to public policy.</p>
