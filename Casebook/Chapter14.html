<p class="image-lensL"><img src="images/ltt.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 7.6 addresses a problem that has plagued humanity for eons: pay-for-play. The legal profession has not been exempt from the temptation of pay-for-play arrangements. Government officials and judges can control lucrative appointments for lawyers in various capacities. These appointment opportunities include, for example, public contract awards, special master appointments, guardian roles, and referee and commissioner positions.</p>
<p class="clear"></p>
<p class="noindent1">A New York newspaper recently reported on alleged appointment scandals in New York courts:</p>
<p class="blockquote">If you&#x2019;re lawyer in New York, there&#x2019;s no sweeter deal than getting assigned to an estate in Surrogate&#x2019;s Court. [&#xB6;] The work is often routine&#x2014;selling assets, paying bills, contacting heirs&#x2014;but the pay can reach into the millions. [&#xB6;] Landing such a gig requires currying favor with one of the city&#x2019;s seven surrogate judges, who handle wills <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page148" class="pagebreak">148</span>and estates. They have the power to appoint lawyers and approve their sometimes jaw-dropping invoices.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_1" id="fn-1">1</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Some lawyers have historically landed these gigs by contributing to the election campaigns of judges or politicians with appointment power or by soliciting political contributions on their behalf from others.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_2" id="fn-2">2</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 7.6 regulates pay-for-play in the context of government and judicial appointments for lawyers who financially support the appointing official&#x2019;s election to obtain appointments themselves. At the same time, this Rule attempts to protect lawyers&#x2019; fundamental right to participate in the political process.</p>
<h3 class="secmain" id="r1-12"><span class="bold">The Rule</span></h3>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 7.6 contains a single sentence:</p>
<div class="blue">
<h3 class="sectiona" id="rs1-29"><img src="images/p148.jpg" alt="Image" /></h3>
<p class="box_h"><span class="bold">Political Contributions to Obtain Legal Engagements or Appointments by Judges</span></p>
<p class="box-noindent">A lawyer or law firm shall not <u>accept a government legal appointment or an appointment by a judge</u> if the lawyer or law firm makes a <u>political contribution or solicits political contributions for the purpose of obtaining or being considered</u> for that type of legal engagement or appointment.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 7.6 seeks to ensure that these types of legal engagements and appointments are merit-based, rather than based on political cronyism or outright bribery.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_3" id="fn-3">3</a></sup></span> Therefore, the Rule prohibits lawyers from accepting this type of appointment if the lawyer made a political contribution or solicited a political contribution for the purpose of being considered for the appointment.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Note several important limitations to Rule 7.6. Recognizing that &#x201C;[l]awyers have a right to participate fully in the political process,&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_4" id="fn-4">4</a></sup></span> Rule 7.6 does not regulate <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page149" class="pagebreak">149</span>political contributions directly&#x2014;the contribution or solicitation must be independently subject to discipline or other legal sanctions.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_5" id="fn-5">5</a></sup></span> Instead, Rule 7.6 limits only the acceptance of <span class="italic">appointments</span> following political contributions or solicitations. Moreover, a lawyer is restricted from accepting the appointment only if the lawyer made or solicited the political contribution with the purpose of being considered for this type of appointment. Therefore, if the lawyer made or solicited the political contribution without this purpose, the lawyer would remain free to accept the appointment. Indeed, the underlying political contribution or solicitation would represent core First Amendment activity, which lawyers do not surrender by accepting a law license.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_6" id="fn-6">6</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Several clarifications in the comments prove very important to the meaning and scope of Rule 7.6. Political contributions, for instance, are defined to include:</p>
<p class="blockquote">[A]ny gift, subscription, loan, advance or deposit of anything of value made directly or indirectly to a candidate, incumbent, political party or campaign committee to influence or provide financial support for election to or retention in judicial or other government office.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_7" id="fn-7">7</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Political contributions under this Rule, however, do not include uncompensated services.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_8" id="fn-8">8</a></sup></span> Further, this Rule does not apply at all to political contributions supporting initiative or referendum elections, where issues instead of candidates are on the ballot.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_9" id="fn-9">9</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">The comments further broadly define legal services that constitute a &#x201C;government legal engagement&#x201D; or &#x201C;appointment by a judge.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_10" id="fn-10">10</a></sup></span> Prohibited engagements and appointments, however, do not include: (1) substantially uncompensated services<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_11" id="fn-11">11</a></sup></span>; (2) merit-based appointments following a request-for-proposal or another process &#x201C;that is free from influence based on political contributions&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_12" id="fn-12">12</a></sup></span>; and (3) rotated appointments based on a list &#x201C;compiled without regard to political contribution.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_13" id="fn-13">13</a></sup></span> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page150" class="pagebreak">150</span>Furthermore, the comments explain how to measure the prohibited purpose under this Rule as &#x201C;being considered for that type of legal engagement or appointment.&#x201D; This purpose exists &#x201C;if, but for the desire to be considered for the legal engagement or appointment, the lawyer or law firm would not have made or solicited the contributions.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_14" id="fn-14">14</a></sup></span> This standard thus requires examination of the total circumstances surrounding the political contribution or solicitation. But, recognizing again the important First Amendment interests underlying political contributions and solicitations, the comments caution that circumstances weighing against the prohibited purpose &#x201C;may include among others that the contribution or solicitation was made to further a political, social, or economic interest or because of an existing personal, family, or professional relationship with a candidate.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_15" id="fn-15">15</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent">Evaluate whether this lawyer engaged in pay-for-play antics prohibited by Rule 7.6:</p>
<p class="image-exeL"><img src="images/exe.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="example"><span class="bolda">Example.</span> Lawyer Max worked in a private law firm with Lawyer Sophia, and Max and Sophia werelongtime friends. Sophia decided to campaign for a judicial position in Family Court, an elected position. Sophia asked Max for help in securing campaign contributions for her election. Before Max responded, Sophia added, &#x201C;By the way, you know I think you are a great lawyer, especially in this area of the law. You&#x2019;d be first on my list for judicial appointments.&#x201D; Max gladly helped Sophia with her campaign. Max always had thought very highly of Sophia and believed she would make an excellent judge in Family Court. Max was especially interested in some of Sophia&#x2019;s ideas for court reform in family law. Max also was excited about the idea of judicial appointments in Family Court&#x2014;Max was confident in his abilities and had seen how lucrative these appointments could be in some cases.</p>
<p class="example">Sophia won the election handily. A short time later, Sophia needed to appoint a lawyer to administer a large estate being probated in her court. Sophia referred to the appointment list that the chief court administrator maintained for qualified lawyers, whom the administrator vetted according to published criteria. Seeing Max on the list, Sophia offered Max the appointment, which Max eagerly accepted. A family member connected to the estate complained when she perceived that Max was making a large <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page151" class="pagebreak">151</span>income from administering the estate. Did Max violate Rule 7.6 when he accepted Sophia&#x2019;s appointment?</p>
<div class="ana">
<p class="analysis"><span class="bolda">Analysis.</span> Max had every right to support Sophia&#x2019;s campaign for Family Court, so long as Max&#x2019;s solicitations abided by other laws regulating political contributions and solicitations for judicial office. Moreover, Max generally could accept appointment by Sophia to the estate administrator position.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_16" id="fn-16">16</a></sup></span> Rule 7.6 prohibited Max from accepting the appointment only if he had supported her campaign in a manner prohibited by Rule 7.6, did so with the purpose of being considered for this type of appointment, and if the appointment was the type of appointment covered by this Rule.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Max solicited direct campaign contributions to support Sophia&#x2019;s election. If these contributions had any value whatsoever, Max&#x2019;s solicitations appeared to fall squarely in Rule 7.6.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_17" id="fn-17">17</a></sup></span> The solicitations were in no way improper themselves, unless they violated some other law regulating solicitations for political contributions. But, under Rule 7.6, this kind of solicitation may have limited Max&#x2019;s subsequent ability to accept an appointment from Sophia.</p>
<p class="noindent1">Sophia did alert Max to the possibility of a judicial appointment when asking Max for help with campaign solicitations. Max also appreciated the potential value of this type of appointment. These circumstances suggest that Max may have solicited political contributions with a purpose of being considered for judicial appointment.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_18" id="fn-18">18</a></sup></span> Yet, Max also had very legitimate reasons for supporting Sophia&#x2019;s candidacy for Family Court, independent of any interest in a subsequent judicial appointment. Max and Sophia were long-time friends and colleagues, Max thought highly of Sophia&#x2019;s qualifications, and Max supported Sophia&#x2019;s ideas for court reform in this area. These factors could indicate that Max did not solicit political contributions for Sophia with the purpose of being considered for judicial appointment.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_19" id="fn-19">19</a></sup></span> If so, for this fact alone, Max did not violate Rule 7.6 when he accepted Sophia&#x2019;s appointment, notwithstanding Max&#x2019;s solicitation of political contributions on Sophia&#x2019;s behalf.</p>
<p class="noindent1">If Max did have the disqualifying purpose when soliciting for Sophia, Max still did not violate Rule 7.6 unless the appointment he accepted fit the Rule&#x2019;s definition of a prohibited appointment. The estate administrator position <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page152" class="pagebreak">152</span>did meet the definition of &#x201C;appointment by a judge.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_20" id="fn-20">20</a></sup></span> But, the fact that Sophia appointed Max from a merit-based list of qualified lawyers may have excepted this appointment from the Rule.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_21" id="fn-21">21</a></sup></span> The exception in this case likely would turn on whether Max was entitled to appointment from this list based on a rotation system or whether Sophia simply chose to appoint Max from the list on her own accord.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_22" id="fn-22">22</a></sup></span> If Sophia&#x2019;s appointment of Max fit in the latter circumstance, Max violated Rule 7.6 by accepting the appointment, if he also had the disqualifying purpose when he solicited on Sophia&#x2019;s behalf.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 7.6 subjects lawyers to discipline when accepting government or judicial appointments in a pay-for-play circumstance. The Rule is not meant to curtail otherwise lawful political activities by lawyers. Nor does this Rule limit the appointments a lawyer may accept when the lawyer in good faith supported the appointing official&#x2019;s campaign. On the contrary, the Rule regulates a lawyer&#x2019;s appointment authority only when political support of the appointing official was motived by the classic quid pro quo of the subsequent appointment.</p>

<p class="noindent1">Lawyers may participate in the political process by supporting the campaigns of judges or political officers. However, lawyers shall not make contributions for the purpose of being considered for political appointments. A lawyer is subject to discipline if he makes a political contribution for the purpose of such an appointment.</p>
