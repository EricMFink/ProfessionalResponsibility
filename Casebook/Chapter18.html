<h3 class="secmain" id="int1-18"><span class="bold">Introduction</span></h3>
<p class="image-lensL"><img src="images/ltt.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="noindent1">No one ever imagined someone making a television show about lawyers managing their client trust accounts. Banks. Accounting. Paperwork. Snoozeville.</p>
<p class="clear"></p>
<p class="noindent1">Yet, proper management of client property and trust accounts is exceptionally important to a lawyer&#x2019;s practice&#x2014;and license. Consider this illustration of the point from just one state: in 347 disciplinary actions against lawyers in the years 2010&#x2013;2013, 113 cases were based on &#x201C;trust account/theft&#x201D; violations&#x2014; close to one-third of the total discipline cases. Moreover, of these 113 violations involving trust account or related theft violations, 81 cases resulted in the most <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page188" class="pagebreak">188</span>serious forms of lawyer discipline: disbarment, resignation in lieu of disbarment, or suspension.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_1" id="fn-1">1</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Clients obviously care about their money and property, as anyone would. Clients, therefore, expect their lawyers to care about that property too. The Rules of Professional Conduct codify this expectation in Rule 1.15. According to this Rule, &#x201C;[a] lawyer should hold property of others with the care required of a professional fiduciary.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_2" id="fn-2">2</a></sup></span> The Cornell University Law School Legal Information Institute online legal dictionary defines &#x201C;fiduciary duty&#x201D; as &#x201C;a duty to act solely in another party&#x2019;s interest &#x2026; . A fiduciary duty is the strictest duty of care recognized by the US legal system.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_3" id="fn-3">3</a></sup></span> Not surprisingly, lawyers run into ethical trouble at a high rate with client property and trust accounts.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The source of this trouble, however, is not that Model Rule 1.15 is enormously complex. Indeed, you likely could survive by following this simple governing mantra: never commingle client property with your personal or business property.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_4" id="fn-4">4</a></sup></span> Rather, lawyers typically get into trouble with client property and trust accounts for other reasons. Sometimes the lawyer is outright dishonest and abuses this fiduciary relationship. In many other instances, the lawyer is not a crook, but he or she lacks an effective system for managing client property and trust accounts.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_5" id="fn-5">5</a></sup></span> This absence of a good management system leads lawyers to make mistakes, cut corners, or be less than truthful to and transparent with clients about their property.</p>
<p class="noindent1">The lesson of this Rule consequently should not be: &#x201C;If I&#x2019;m an honest lawyer, I will be okay.&#x201D; The lesson should be: &#x201C;If I&#x2019;m an honest lawyer who competently and diligently maintains a client property and trust account management system, I will be okay.&#x201D; This kind of system obviously goes well beyond the Rules of Professional Conduct and involves general good business management practices. Some states, like Delaware, supplement Rule 1.15 with more detailed client property and trust account rules.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_6" id="fn-6">6</a></sup></span> A great resource for navigating the complex rule, as well as this course, are the client trust account guides published by many State Bar <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page189" class="pagebreak">189</span>Associations.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_7" id="fn-7">7</a></sup></span> These publications should be must-read resources for you in the state or states where you practice.</p>
<h3 class="secmain" id="r1-16"><span class="bold">The Rule</span></h3>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 1.15 has multiple subsections. The first subsections outline a lawyer&#x2019;s responsibility to separate and safeguard client property. The second two subsections address the lawyer&#x2019;s duty to deliver property to a client or third party, and how to manage disputes about who in fact is entitled to that property.</p>
<h4 class="secsub" id="s2-49"><span class="bold">1.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Separating Property</span></h4>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 1.15, subsection (a) establishes a lawyer&#x2019;s basic duty when holding the property of a client or a third person:</p>
<div class="blue">
<h3 class="sectiona" id="rs1-40"><img src="images/p189.jpg" alt="Image" /></h3>
<p class="box_h"><span class="bold">Safekeeping Property</span></p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(a)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;A lawyer shall hold the property of clients or third persons that is in the lawyer&#x2019;s possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyer&#x2019;s own property. Funds shall be kept in a separate account designed solely in connection with the practice of law in this jurisdiction &#x2026; . [S]uch funds shall be maintained in the state in which the lawyer&#x2019;s office is situated or elsewhere with the consent of the client or third person &#x2026; . Other property shall be identified as such and appropriately safeguarded. Complete records of such account funds and other property shall be kept by the lawyer and shall be preserved for a period of five years after termination of the events that they record.</p>
</div>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page190" class="pagebreak">190</div>
<p class="noindent1">This Rule establishes one of the most fundamental duties of lawyer: separating and safeguarding the client&#x2019;s property.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_8" id="fn-8">8</a></sup></span> A lawyer categorically may not &#x201C;commingle&#x201D; the client&#x2019;s property with the lawyer&#x2019;s property, because of the risk that commingling will result in loss, oversight, or malfeasance. A lawyer thus must place a client&#x2019;s money in &#x201C;one or more trust accounts&#x201D; that remain wholly separate from any business or personal account of the lawyer.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_9" id="fn-9">9</a></sup></span> In only one circumstance may a lawyer put her or his money into a client trust account: to pay bank service charges on that account and no more.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_10" id="fn-10">10</a></sup></span> Even for the most beneficent of reasons, a lawyer may not put his or her money into the client&#x2019;s account, nor the client&#x2019;s money into the lawyer&#x2019;s account.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_11" id="fn-11">11</a></sup></span> Further, the client does not need to be injured for a lawyer to be subject to discipline as commingling itself violates the Rule.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_12" id="fn-12">12</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">This Rule thus is pretty simple at face value, but maintaining a daily practice consistent with this Rule is another matter. The Rule requires diligence and competence in the business practice of consistently handling client property. For instance, California&#x2019;s Handbook on Client Trust Accounting for California Attorneys has ten single-spaced pages dedicated solely to &#x201C;Key concepts in client trust accounting&#x201D; and &#x201C;Opening a client trust bank account.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_13" id="fn-13">13</a></sup></span> A lawyer must do his or her homework on the nuts and bolts of client trust account management.</p>
<p class="noindent1">In one important example, a lawyer must distinguish between short- and longterm client holdings in deciding the kind of account into which to deposit client money. When a lawyer holds a client&#x2019;s money for an extended period of time, or in a large amount, where the interest on that holding would exceed the cost of a separate account, the lawyer generally should put the money into a dedicated trust account for that client.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_14" id="fn-14">14</a></sup></span> Because the client owns the principal on that account, the client also owns any interest that the principal bears.</p>
<p class="noindent1">When a lawyer holds smaller amounts of client money, however, or holds client funds for shorter periods of time, the lawyer may deposit the money into a pooled client trust account. The lawyer is not expected to disperse interest proportionately to the clients whose assets are held in the account, nor will the lawyer keep the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page191" class="pagebreak">191</span>interest. Rather, these accounts typically must be an &#x201C;Interest on Lawyer&#x2019;s Trust Account&#x201D; (IOLTA).<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_15" id="fn-15">15</a></sup></span> The bank will send IOLTA interest to the State Bar. The State Bar may use the money to compensate victims of dishonest lawyers.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_16" id="fn-16">16</a></sup></span> The State Bar, however, also may use IOLTA funds to resource other Bar projects or causes, some of which may be viewed as political. IOLTA requirements, thus, have been challenged as a governmental taking<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_17" id="fn-17">17</a></sup></span> or simply bad policy.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_18" id="fn-18">18</a></sup></span> Despite the challenges, IOLTA programs have been upheld,<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_19" id="fn-19">19</a></sup></span> and State Bars continue to maintain them. Rule 1.15 requires that &#x201C;[w]here such a fund has been established, a lawyer must participate where it is mandatory, and, even when it is voluntary, the lawyer should participate.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_20" id="fn-20">20</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent">Another challenge for lawyers in following this Rule involves identifying to whom property belongs. Comment 9 of Rule 1.15 makes clear that any advance payment of fees or expenses still belongs to the client until the lawyer earns the fee or incurs the expense, consistent with the fee agreement. What about a true retainer fee or a flat fee&#x2014;who owns that money when a client gives it to a lawyer? Consider these problems under Rule 1.15(a):</p>
<p class="image-exeL"><img src="images/exe.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="example"><span class="bolda">Example.</span> Client and Lawyer agreed to an hourly fee for Lawyer&#x2019;s representation, and Client gave Lawyer $1,100 at the first meeting to cover the following costs: $300 advance on anticipated expenses; $100 fee for the initial consolation; and $700 advance on anticipated legal fees. Lawyer should deposit what money into which account?</p>
<div class="ana">
<p class="analysis"><span class="bolda">Analysis.</span> Lawyer earned the $100 fee for the consultation, so that money must go into the Lawyer&#x2019;s own account. Lawyer will not earn the expenses advance, even when it is dispersed. Therefore, the expenses must be placed into and remain in the client trust account until those expenses are in fact incurred. Lawyer may earn the fee advance as Lawyer works on the case, but until Lawyer does earn that money, it belongs to Client. Comment 9 of Rule 1.15 provides that a Lawyer must deposit the fee advance into the client trust account and withdraw that money only when the fee is earned, consistent <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page192" class="pagebreak">192</span>with the fee agreement. Lawyer should agree with Client on a system and schedule for withdrawing fees as they are earned, in order to avoid misunderstandings or disputes over whether Lawyer in fact earned fees that Lawyer withdraws.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_21" id="fn-21">21</a></sup></span> Some jurisdictions require that a lawyer notify a client of an intent to withdraw earned fees from a client trust account,<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_22" id="fn-22">22</a></sup></span> which is good practice even if not required.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_23" id="fn-23">23</a></sup></span></p>
</div>
<p class="image-exeL"><img src="images/exe.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="example"><span class="bolda">Example.</span> For $1,500, Client retained Lawyer to be available for legal services during a specified time period. Client will pay Lawyer an additional fee for any legal services performed. Should Lawyer deposit the $1,500 retainer fee into Lawyer&#x2019;s account or the client trust account?</p>
<div class="ana">
<p class="analysis"><span class="bolda">Analysis.</span> Lawyer received a fee for an availability, or &#x201C;true,&#x201D; retainer. Rule 1.15 does not indicate how a lawyer should handle these funds. On one hand, a lawyer may not earn this money until she or he completes the terms of the availability retainer. On the other hand, by agreeing to be available in advance, the lawyer has committed her or himself to lost future opportunities due to the lawyer&#x2019;s unavailability for other matters. Several jurisdictions have clarified how lawyers should handle these funds, with many jurisdictions deciding that the lawyer earns that money upon agreeing to the availability retainer.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_24" id="fn-24">24</a></sup></span> Under this view, Lawyer should place that money into Lawyer&#x2019;s own account. Lawyer, however, should check how her specific jurisdiction instructs her on this question.</p>
</div>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page193" class="pagebreak">193</div>
<p class="image-exeL"><img src="images/exe.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="example"><span class="bolda">Example.</span> Client retained Lawyer for a flat fee of $2,500 to pay for a defined amount of legal services. Should Lawyer deposit the $2,500 flat fee into Lawyer&#x2019;s account or the client trust account?</p>
<div class="ana">
<p class="analysis"><span class="bolda">Analysis.</span> Lawyer received a flat fee for providing defined legal services. Rule 1.15 also does not indicate how a lawyer should handle these funds. In one view, a lawyer has not earned this money until she or he completes the legal services in return for the flat fee, as the client ultimately could be due a refund for incomplete or less substantial work. Under this view, a flat fee should be treated like any other fee advance, which goes into the client trust account.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_25" id="fn-25">25</a></sup></span> In another view, however, by committing to the defined legal services in advance, the lawyer has committed those legal services to the client to the exclusion of other work opportunities, and the client has committed to pay that fee. Consistent with this view, &#x201C;[t]he majority of jurisdictions have held that flat fees may, with the consent of the client, be considered to be earned upon receipt and therefore not required to be placed in a trust account.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_26" id="fn-26">26</a></sup></span> Lawyer accordingly will need to investigate what her jurisdiction requires concerning a flat fee.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_27" id="fn-27">27</a></sup></span></p>
</div>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page194" class="pagebreak">194</div>
<h4 class="secsub" id="s2-50"><span class="bold">2.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Notification, Delivery, and Accounting</span></h4>
<p class="noindent1">In subsection (b), Model Rule 1.15 regulates how a lawyer must handle and deliver property:</p>
<div class="blue">
<h3 class="sectiona" id="rs1-41"><img src="images/p189.jpg" alt="Image" /></h3>
<p class="box_h"><span class="bold">Safekeeping Property</span></p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(b)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;Upon receiving funds or other property in which a client or a third person has an interest, a lawyer shall promptly notify the client or third person. Except as stated in this rule or otherwise permitted by law or by agreement with the client, a lawyer shall promptly deliver to the client or third person any funds or other property that the client or third person is entitled to receive, and, upon request by the client or third person, shall promptly render a full accounting regarding such property.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent1">This Rule reinforces the notion that a lawyer holds a client or third person&#x2019;s property for that person&#x2019;s benefit. Therefore, when receiving property in which the client or a third person has an interest, the lawyer must notify that person promptly to ensure that the client or third person can claim the property or instruct the lawyer on how to handle it. Presumptively, the lawyer will promptly deliver the property to the client or third person, unless the lawyer is not authorized to do so. The lawyer must, therefore, maintain complete records of this property, because the client is entitled to an accounting on request. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll look into it&#x201D; is not a satisfactory response to this request. The Rules of Professional Conduct presume that a lawyer will retain complete accounting records for five years.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_28" id="fn-28">28</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">3. Property disputes. Sometimes, property in a lawyer&#x2019;s possession will be subject to an ownership dispute. Rule 1.15(c) addresses this circumstance:</p>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page195" class="pagebreak">195</div>
<div class="blue">
<h3 class="sectiona" id="rs1-42"><img src="images/p189.jpg" alt="Image" /></h3>
<p class="box_h"><span class="bold">Safekeeping Property</span></p>
<p class="box1-noindenth"><span class="bold">(c)</span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;When in the course of representation a lawyer is in possession of property in which both the lawyer and another person claim interests, the property shall be kept separate by the lawyer until there is an accounting and severance of their interests. If a dispute arises concerning their respective interests, the portion in dispute shall be kept separate by the lawyer until the dispute is resolved. This Rule recognizes that lawyers may hold property to which more than one person claims an interest&#x2014;including the lawyer, typically as an unpaid fee claim. The lawyer should not attempt to arbitrate these disputes.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_29" id="fn-29">29</a></sup></span> Rather, consistent with the lawyer&#x2019;s fiduciary duties, the lawyer should distribute all property not subject to dispute, and continue to hold in trust the property subject to non-frivolous claims.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_30" id="fn-30">30</a></sup></span> In a dispute between the lawyer and the client concerning property held in trust, the lawyer &#x201C;should suggest means for prompt resolution of the dispute, such as arbitration.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_31" id="fn-31">31</a></sup></span></p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">Analyze this example under Rule 1.15, subsections (b) and (c):</p>
<p class="image-exeL"><img src="images/exe.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="example"><span class="bolda">Example.</span> Lawyer represented Client in arbitration. Client agreed that Lawyer would receive one-third of the arbitration award. A third-party lienholder also claimed a non-frivolous right to the arbitration award to cover a $50,000 debt. After arbitration, Client was awarded $100,000 to be paid by the opposing party&#x2019;s insurance provider. The insurance company issued the award check payable to both Lawyer and Client. When Lawyer contacted Client about endorsing the check to cover her fee and settle the lien, Client responded by email, &#x201C;That check belongs to me. You endorse it to me, and I&#x2019;ll take care of my business. Until then, don&#x2019;t expect me to sign anything.&#x201D; Lawyer suspected that Client was unhappy that he might receive only $17,000 of the award and was trying to strong-arm his way into keeping more of the award for himself, despite the claims against the award. Lawyer contacted the insurance provider, who agreed to re-issue the check as payable solely to Lawyer as &#x201C;trustee&#x201D; of Client&#x2019;s <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page196" class="pagebreak">196</span>award. Lawyer advised Client: &#x201C;I have deposited the $100,000 into a trust account pending your instructions. When you acknowledge that I am entitled to my $33,000 fee, I will release $17,000 to you. I will hold the remaining $50,000 in trust pending resolution of your creditor&#x2019;s lien. Please advise what action you would like me to take to facilitate resolution of that claim.&#x201D; Did Lawyer handle Client&#x2019;s award properly?</p>
<div class="ana">
<p class="analysis"><span class="bolda">Analysis.</span> Lawyer handled some aspects of this situation properly. For instance, Lawyer properly maintained her claimed fee in trust pending resolution of any dispute with Client,<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_32" id="fn-32">32</a></sup></span> who seemed implicitly to dispute Lawyer&#x2019;s claim by refusing to cooperate with the settlement of the award. Lawyer also properly refused to release the $50,000 to which the lienholder claimed a non-frivolous interest and kept that money in trust pending resolution.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_33" id="fn-33">33</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Lawyer, however, may have violated Rule 1.15 in two respects. First, Lawyer likely should not have sought and accepted the re-issued check made payable to her alone as &#x201C;trustee.&#x201D; This action directly contravened Client&#x2019;s express wishes concerning this property, to which Client had an undisputed interest of $17,000. Client also implicitly indicated that he might dispute Lawyer or the lienholder&#x2019;s claim by seemingly refusing to cooperate in settling the award. Lawyer&#x2019;s effort to possess the award unilaterally put Lawyer into potential conflict with Client over this property.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_34" id="fn-34">34</a></sup></span></p>
<p class="noindent1">Second, Lawyer should not have held Client&#x2019;s undisputed $17,000 interest hostage pending Client&#x2019;s assent to Lawyer&#x2019;s fee claim. Regardless of the merit of Lawyer&#x2019;s claimed fee, Rule 1.15 obliged Lawyer, as a fiduciary, to &#x201C;promptly distribute&#x201D; the &#x201C;undisputed portion.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_35" id="fn-35">35</a></sup></span> In this respect, &#x201C;a lawyer may not hold funds to coerce a client into accepting the lawyer&#x2019;s contention.&#x201D;<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_36" id="fn-36">36</a></sup></span> Once Lawyer secured the award, absent other instructions from Client, Lawyer should have delivered the undisputed $17,000 portion of the award to Client. Lawyer properly could keep the disputed $33,000 fee in trust, and should have suggested means for prompt resolution of that dispute.<span class="bold"><sup><a href="#fn_37" id="fn-37">37</a></sup></span></p>
</div>
<div epub:type="pagebreak" id="page197" class="pagebreak">197</div>
<p class="noindent1">Rule 1.15 itself may not be not rocket science. The serious challenge comes in establishing and maintaining the diligent and competent business practices to comply with this Rule, consistent with a lawyer&#x2019;s fiduciary duty. Lawyers must meet this challenge, however, because this duty puts lawyers in peril of serious discipline if they fail in this charge, even if the lawyer was merely inadvertent, and even if the client is not harmed.</p>
<div class="quick1">
<p class="quick" id="qs1-18"><span class="bold">Quick Summary</span></p>
<p class="fold-L1"><img src="images/fold1.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>
<p class="noindent1"><span class="bold">Rule 1.15</span> requires a lawyer to securely keep client and third-person property separate from the lawyer&#x2019;s property. Client property must be held in a proper trust account. Client funds include unearned legal fees and expenses, which may be withdrawn from the client trust account only as fees are earned and expenses are incurred. Upon receipt of property in which the client or a third person has an interest, the lawyer shall promptly notify that person, deliver the property, and fully account for the property upon request. If a lawyer possesses property in which two or more persons, who could include the lawyer, claim an interest, the lawyer shall keep the property separate until the dispute is resolved, but promptly distribute all portions of the property as to which the interests are not in dispute.</p>
