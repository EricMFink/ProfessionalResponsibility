_Preface_

Thank you for your interest in _Professional Responsibility: An
Open-Access Casebook_. We hope that you find it useful and informative.

This is a free casebook. We believe that law students and others
interested in the law should not have to pay the high prices that
commercial publishers charge for casebooks. Many others agree, and have
created free or low-cost casebooks covering many different areas of the
law. Here are some examples:

We noticed that there was no free and open-source casebook available for
a professional responsibility class, so we decided to create one.

This casebook covers a wide range of different subjects related to the
professional responsibility of attorneys. While it is possible to cover
all of this material in a three credit-hour course, you may wish to omit
some subjects. You may also wish to supplement the materials in this
casebook with additional materials. We encourage you to use this
casebook in any way that you like.

This casebook is licensed "Creative Commons 0 / No Rights Reserved."
That means that we explicitly disclaim any copyright claim in all of the
original elements that we created in writing this casebook and have
intentionally placed the casebook in the public domain. Because this
casebook is in the public domain, you can use the materials in it in any
way that you like, with or without attribution. Of course, the casebook
contains many copyrighted elements that belong to other people and that
we used pursuant to fair use. Those elements are still protected by
copyright.

We hope that this free casebook helps show that it is possible to create
teaching materials for legal education in an open-source format. And we
hope it makes access to the law governing legal practice more accessible
to law students, attorneys, and anyone interested in the regulation of
the legal profession.

In closing, we would like to thank our research assistants Nicole
Pottinger, Justin Cloyd, Mark Blankenship, Barrett Block, and Renee
Wilson. We would also like to thank Cornelius Kearns, Brandon Magner,
and Guy Hamilton-Smith for helpful comments.
