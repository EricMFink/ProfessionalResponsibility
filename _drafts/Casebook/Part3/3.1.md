# 3.1: Fiduciary Duties

Attorneys are fiduciaries of their clients. As fiduciaries, they have certain legal duties to their clients:

### Duty of Care

- Ordinary care under the circumstances. 

### Duty of Loyalty

- Absolute loyalty. 

### Duty of Impartiality

- Absolute candor. 

### Duty of Confidentiality

- Absolute confidentiality. 

The duties of care, loyalty, impartiality, and confidentiality attach whenever an attorney-client relationship begins and may continue after an attorney-client relationship ends. Accordingly, attorneys may owe duties to both current and former clients, which may affect an attorneys actions or omissions breached the duty of care. Typically, an attorney breaches the duty of care by providing negligent legal advice or by negligently failing to act in the clients breach of the duty of care caused harm to the plaintiff. Like any other tort, a plaintiff can recover on a legal malpractice action claim only if the malpractice caused harm, and only to the extent of the harm.

## The Duty of Loyalty

Attorneys are fiduciaries of their clients because clients justifiably vest confidence, good faith, reliance, and trust in their attorneys. Accordingly, attorneys have a fiduciary duty to maintain an undivided loyalty to their clients at all times. Attorneys must ensure that their duties to their clients never conflict with their own financial interests, the interests of another client, or any other interest that would affect their ability to provide competent and diligent representation.

Under the duty of loyalty, attorneys cannot represent anyone with an interest adverse to one of their clients, because it would create a conflict of interest. If that interest becomes an issue, the attorneys interests are adverse or potentially adverse to the attorneys impartiality. Under those circumstances, attorneys will have an incentive to provide advice that benefits themselves or their other clients, and withhold advice that does not. Even if the client is not harmed by the advice itself, the client is harmed by not receiving candid and impartial advice reflecting the full range of available options.

For example, if an attorney represents a client in a contract negotiation, and the outcome of the negotiation could affect the interests of another client, a conflict of interest exists, because the attorney has an incentive to provide advice that will benefit the first client and withhold advice that will harm the second client. Even if the advice benefits both clients, the client receiving the advice is harmed by not receiving candid and impartial advice. Likewise, if an attorney both represents and has a financial interest in a corporation, a conflict of interest exists, because the attorney has an incentive to provide advice that will benefit the attorneys interests are adverse or potentially adverse to the attorneys ability to maintain confidentiality. Under those circumstances, attorneys have an incentive to use the confidential information for their own benefit or the benefit of their other client. Even if the client is not harmed by the use of the confidential information, the client is harmed by the betrayal of trust.

# Model Rule 1.6: Confidentiality of Information

(a) A lawyer shall not reveal information relating to the representation of a client unless the client gives informed consent, the disclosure is impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation or the disclosure is permitted.

</div>

## Limitations on the Duties of an Attorney

While the absolute duties of loyalty, impartiality, and confidentiality are the quintessence of professional responsibility, they are not always enforced to the letter. Taken literally, they would inevitably preclude attorneys from ever representing more than one client. It is always possible that the interests of a potential client will conflict with those of a current client. It is always possible that advice given to one client will affect the interests of another client. And it is always possible that confidential information disclosed by one client will be relevant to another. In practice, the duties of an attorney must yield to the practical realities of representation.

Accordingly, the duties of attorneys are shaped by the rights of clients, attorneys, and the bar.

- Clients are entitled to hire the attorney of their choice, and may consent to representation, despite a formal conflict.

- Attorneys are entitled to represent more than one client, so long as they disclose any conflicts and the client consents.

- The bar is entitled to prevent parties from using conflicts strategically to disqualify opposing counsel.

In other words, clients may provide informed consent to certain conflicts of interest. Attorneys may represent clients with conflicts of interests under certain circumstances, so long as the clients provide informed consent. And under certain circumstances, the bar may even permit attorneys to represent parties with conflicting interests without consent.

However, attorneys must _always_ observe the _duty of care_. An attorney who fails to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances is negligent and potentially liable for malpractice, even if the client consents.

# Ishmael v. Millington

## 241 Cal. App. 2d 520 (Cal. Ct. App. 1966)

<div markdown="block" class="case-summary">

_Summary:_ Earl F. Anders and Roberta Ishmael were married and owned a trucking company. Eventually, they decided to divorce. Under California law, Ishmael was entitled to 50% of the marital assets. Attorney Robert Millington had previously represented Anders and his company. Anders asked Millington to represent Ishmael. He agreed, and prepared a settlement agreement that Ishmael signed. Ishmael was entitled to $41,250, but under the agreement she received $8,807. Ishmael filed a malpractice action, and the trial court granted Millingtonthe attorney, by accepting employment to give legal advice or to render other legal services, impliedly agrees to use such skill, prudence, and diligence as lawyers of ordinary skill and capacity commonly possess and exercise in the performance of the tasks which they undertake. request Mr. Millington agreed to act as the wife's attorney, to prepare the necessary papers and to file a divorce action for her. He drew up a complaint and a property settlement agreement and handed these documents to Mr. Anders, who took them to Sacramento and had his wife sign them. She knew that Mr. Millington had represented her husband in the past. Faulty recall prevents ascertainment whether Mrs. Anders ever met personally with the attorney before the papers were drawn. She did not discuss the property settlement agreement with the attorney before she signed it. Mr. Millington believed the divorce and property settlement arrangements were between the husband and wife; he he believed that she was actually getting half the property but made no effort to confirm that belief.

</div>

In her deposition the former Mrs. Anders testified that in signing the complaint and property settlement agreement she relied solely on her husband and did not rely on the attorney. Later, when so instructed, she traveled to the courthouse at Oroville, where she and her corroborating witness met Mr. Millington. He escorted her through a routine ex parte hearing which resulted in an interlocutory divorce decree and judicial approval of the property settlement.

According to her complaint, the former Mrs. Anders discovered that in return for a settlement of $8,807 she had surrendered her right to community assets totaling $82,500. Ascribing her loss to the attorney's negligent failure to make inquiries as to the true worth of the community property, she seeks damages equivalent to the difference between what she received and one-half the asserted value of the community.

By the very act of undertaking to represent Mrs. Anders in an uncontested divorce suit, Mr. Millington assumed a duty of care toward her, whatever its degree. Described in terms traditionally applicable to the attorney-client relationship, the degree of care exacted by that duty was that of a figurative lawyer of ordinary skill and capacity in the performance of like tasks.

The degree of care is related to the specific situation in which the defendant found himself. The standard is that of ordinary care under the circumstances of the particular case. A lawyer owes undivided loyalty to his client. Minimum standards of professional ethics usually permit him to represent dual interests where full consent and full disclosure occur. The loyalty he owes one client cannot consume that owed to the other. Most descriptions of professional conduct prohibit his undertaking to represent conflicting interests at all; or demand that he terminate the three-way relationship when adversity of interest appears. Occasional statements sanction informed representation of divergent interests in situations. Even those statements demand complete disclosure of all facts and circumstances which, in the attorney's honest judgment, may influence his client's choice, holding the attorney civilly liable for loss caused by lack of disclosure.

Divorces are frequently uncontested; the parties may make their financial arrangements peaceably and honestly; vestigial chivalry may impel them to display the wife as the injured plaintiff; the husband may then seek out and pay an attorney to escort the wife through the formalities of adjudication. We describe these facts of life without necessarily approving them. Even in that situation the attorneys length divorce, an attorney of ordinary professional skill would demand some verification of the husbands professional obligations demand no less. He may not set a shallow limit on the depth to which he will represent the wife.

The general standard of professional care is appropriate to the garden variety situation, where the attorney represents only one of several parties or interests. It falls short of adequate description where the attorney's professional relationship extends to two clients with divergent or conflicting interests in the same subject matter. A more specific statement of the same rule is needed to guide the fact trier to the law's demands when the attorney attempts dual representation. In short, an attorney representing two parties with divergent interests must disclose all facts and circumstances which, in the judgment of a lawyer of ordinary skill and capacity, are necessary to enable his client to make free and intelligent decisions regarding the subject matter of the representation.

In view of the degree of care imposed by law on an attorney in defendant's position, a fact trier might reasonably find him negligent in failing to disclose to plaintiff the limited representation she was receiving and in failing to point to the possibility of independent legal advice. The question of breach was thus a triable issue which could not be resolved on a summary judgment motion.

Legal malpractice may consist of a negligent failure to act. The attorney's negligence, whether consisting of active conduct or a failure to act, need not be the sole cause of the client's loss. Here the attorney is charged not with erroneous advice, but with failure to advise, failure to investigate, failure to disclose. The wife's reliance on her husbandthe appearance of impropriety.the appearance of impropriety.the appearance of impropriety in all his actions.the test for the appearance of impropriety is whether the conduct would create in reasonable minds a perception that the judge's ability to carry out judicial responsibilities with integrity, impartiality and competence is impaired.ethical consideration,disciplinary rule,appearance of improprietyHPETsit will result in the layoff of at least six times as many female HPETs as male HPETs.s members may apply to obtain legal representation free of charge. Mr. Sandner and his staff may take an applicant's case when, in their judgment, the claim is both job-related and meritorious. It is through this procedure that the male defendants retained Mr. Sandner as their attorney. NYSUT itself, however, has taken no position on the merits or on any other issue in this litigation.

The female HPETs moved to disqualify Mr. Sandner as counsel for the male HPETs or, in the alternative, to require NYSUT to furnish counsel for the female teachers. Judge Lasker concluded that legal expenses.at least the spirit, if not the letter, of Canon 9 of the Code of Professional Responsibility that s confidence in the vigor of the attorney's representation of his client, or more commonly (2) where the attorney is at least potentially in a position to use privileged information concerning the other side through prior representation, for example, in violation of Canons 4 and 9, thus giving his present client an unfair advantage. In such cases, we note Chief Judge Kaufman's oft-quoted admonition that,

> When dealing with ethical principles, we cannot paint with broad strokes. The lines are fine and must be so marked. Guideposts can be established when virgin ground is being explored, and the conclusion in a particular case can be reached only after a painstaking analysis of the facts and precise application of precedent.

But in other kinds of cases, we have shown considerable reluctance to disqualify attorneys despite misgivings about the attorney's conduct. This reluctance probably derives from the fact that disqualification has an immediate adverse effect on the client by separating him from counsel of his choice, and that disqualification motions are often interposed for tactical reasons. And even when made in the best of faith, such motions inevitably cause delay. For example, this lawsuit has been at a standstill now for close to a year.

Weighing the needs of efficient judicial administration against the potential advantage of immediate preventive measures, we believe that unless an attorney's conduct tends to by disturbing the balance of the presentations in one of the two ways indicated above, courts should be quite hesitant to disqualify an attorney. Given the availability of both federal and state comprehensive disciplinary machinery, there is usually no need to deal with all other kinds of ethical violations in the very litigation in which they surface.

With these thoughts in mind, we turn to the ethical problems presented by the instant appeal. The district court disqualified Mr. Sandner because a by the fact that There is no claim, however, that Mr. Sandner feels any sense of loyalty to the women that would undermine his representation of the men. Nor is there evidence that his representation of the men is anything less than vigorous. There is also no claim that the men have gained an unfair advantage through any access to privileged information about the women. Were there any such problem, the women would not be asking, and the district judge would not have ordered, as an alternative to disqualification of Mr. Sandner, that NYSUT pay their attorney's fees. Thus, in no real sense can Mr. Sandner's representation of the men be said to taint the trial.

We agree that there is at least some possibility that Mr. Sandner's representation of the men has the appearance of impropriety, because of the large number of union members involved and the public importance of the civil rights issue at the heart of the dispute. But in any event, we think that disqualification was inappropriate. We believe that when there is no claim that the trial will be tainted, appearance of impropriety is simply too slender a reed on which to rest a disqualification order except in the rarest cases. This is particularly true where, as in this case, the appearance of impropriety is not very clear. We note that while on one hand there is an element of unfairness to the women, on the other it seems probable that if NYSUT were to take a position on the merits of this litigation, Mr. Sandner's representation of the men would apparently be within the protection of the "fair representation" cases. This means that the question whether Mr. Sandner's conduct is unethical could be a very close one. Since disqualification entails immediate disruption of the litigation, it is better to relegate any questions about Mr. Sandner's conduct to other appropriate proceedings. In addition to the possibility of grievance proceedings and an internal union attack on the legal plan, it may be that judicial construction of the plan, in an appropriate lawsuit, could provide some relief for the women.

We therefore reverse the order of the district court disqualifying counsel, and remand for continuation of the action.

# In re Disciplinary Proc. Against Sanders

## 145 P. 3d 1208 (Wa. 2006)

<div markdown="block" class="case-summary">

_Summary:_ Justice Sanders of the Washington Supreme Court visited the Special Commitment Center on McNeil Island, which houses people civilly committed as sexually violent predators. During the visit, Sanders accepted documents from inmates and asked them about volitional control, among other things. The Attorney General of Washington filed a complaint against Sanders with the Washington Commission on Judicial Conduct. After an investigation and a hearing, the Commission found that Sanders violated Canon 1 by failing to enforce high standards of judicial conduct and also violated Canon 2(A) by failing to promote public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. Sanders appealed and the court affirmed. 

</div>

A visit by a judicial officer to a special facility for sexually violent predators is not in itself inappropriate conduct under the Code of Judicial Conduct. However, conversations with the residents of the facility concerning the reasons for their confinement, particularly when one or more of these residents has a matter or matters pending before the court on which the judge sits, can violate the Code of Judicial Conduct. By asking questions of inmates who were litigants or should have been recognized as potential litigants on issues currently pending before the court, Justice Richard B. Sanders violated the Code of Judicial Conduct. His conduct created an appearance of partiality as a result of ex parte contact.

The Washington Commission on Judicial Conduct received a complaint on March 18, 2003, regarding Justice Sanders' conduct while visiting the Special Commitment Center (SCC) on McNeil Island. The Commission conducted an independent investigation of the allegations, determined that sufficient evidence existed to support the complaint, and sent a Statement of Allegations to Justice Sanders on October 8, 2003. In April 2004, the Commission determined that probable cause existed to believe that Justice Sanders violated Canons 1, 2(A) and 3(A)(4) of the Code of Judicial Conduct. After a fact-finding hearing, the Commission issued its decision holding that Justice Sanders violated Canons 1 and 2(A), but did not violate Canon 3(A)(4). The Commission found that Justice Sanders' conduct violated Canon 1 by failing to enforce high standards of judicial conduct and also violated Canon 2(A) by failing to promote public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. The Commission imposed the sanction of admonishment. Under Discipline Rules for Judges 3, Justice Sanders filed a notice of contest.

Justice Sanders embarked on a tour of the SCC despite warnings from his colleagues on the Supreme Court about potential ex parte contact with litigants. During the tour of this facility, Justice Sanders accepted documents on two separate occasions from the inmates. Moreover, in meetings with the residents, some of whom had cases pending before the court, he directly asked them about the issue of volitional control.

At the time of the visit, the Supreme Court was in the process of deciding _In re Detention of Thorell_. Drafts of both a majority opinion and a dissent by Justice Sanders were circulating among the justices at the Supreme Court. _Thorell_ was a seminal case in which separate actions by six petitioners were combined, including at least one of the SCC residents with whom Justice Sanders met. A pivotal issue before the Supreme Court in _Thorell_ was volitional control. The court was weighing whether the Thus, the factual record was before the court in each of the consolidated six cases.

The Commission held, and we agree, that the record established through clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that Justice Sanders violated Canons 1 and 2(A). In support of that holding, the findings reference two of the three letters from resident Andre Brigham Young inviting the justices to visit McNeil Island. Those letters indicate that the residents were looking for something more than just a tour of the facility. In fact, Young suggested that others (opposing counsel and defense attorneys) should be asked to attend to avoid The letters in and of themselves should have given sufficient notice to Justice Sanders that this visit had the potential of being more than an institutional tour. Additional warning flags were also raised by three justices who expressed concerns about the visit and potential problems. Moreover, a simple computer check would have revealed that Rickey Calhoun and Andre Brigham Young, two people mentioned in the prior communication with Justice Sanders, had cases pending before the Supreme Court. When Justice Sanders met with the residents in small groups, he warned the residents that he could not hear their particular case issues. However, these warnings were followed by specific questions asking the residents about their confinement and what they thought of volitional control.

The Commission justifiably found that Justice Sanders, with full awareness of the potential for situations that could conflict with the Code of Judicial Conduct, embarked on the tour and met with litigants who had pending cases before the court. Further, by raising such critical issues as volitional control with these litigants, Justice Sanders created a situation that clearly violated both the letter and the spirit of the canons and created serious concern for both counsel and fellow jurists about the appearance of partiality.

Justice Sanders claims that a violation of Canons 1 and 2(A) cannot be found without a concomitant violation of a proscribed act or canon and thus the Commission's failure to find a direct violation of Canon 3(A)(4) precludes it from finding a violation of the other canons. We disagree.

In our view, _Turco_ is dispositive. There, the court found that the judge's act of striking his wife in public had a sufficient nexus to the judicial role, particularly when the judge heard domestic violence cases. If extrajudicial tortious conduct can provide a nexus to the judicial role, then a fortiori, judicial conduct can provide a basis for a violation of Canons 1 and 2(A). In the instant case, Justice Sandersreasonable traveling expensesbusiness of the courts decisions are tainted by even a mere suspicion of partiality, the effect on the public's confidence can be debilitating. The canons of judicial conduct should be viewed in broad fashion, and judges should err on the side of caution. Under Canon 3(D)(1), In _Sherman_, the court found that where a trial judge The court set the test for determining impartiality:

> In deciding recusal matters, actual prejudice is not the standard. The Commission recognizes that where a trial judge's decisions are tainted by even a mere suspicion of partiality, the effect on the public's confidence in our judicial system can be debilitating. The test for determining whether the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned is an objective test that assumes that 

This court in _In re Disciplinary Proceeding Against Sanders_ noted that the interest of the State in maintaining and enforcing high standards of judicial conduct under the auspices of Canon 1 is a compelling one. In _Sanders_, this court balanced that interest against Justice Sanders' First Amendment rights and found that an independent basis for finding a violation of Canon 1 under those circumstances was not possible. Justice Sanders argues that the language in Canon 1 is hortatory and therefore cannot stand as an independent basis for a violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct. In the instant case, Canon 1 sets the conceptual framework under which Canon 2(A) operates. Canon 2(A) provides the more specific restraint, to wit: Under the circumstances of this case, Canon 1 taken in conjunction with Canon 2(A) provides a sufficiently specific basis to find a violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct. Here, it was clear that there was a substantial basis and expectation that Justice Sanders would be in contact with possible litigants who had pending litigation before the court and that this contact would be viewed as improper. We concur with the Commission's finding that it was clearly reasonable to question the impartiality of the justice under the circumstances of this case.

# Questions

Why did the court hold that visiting the Special Commitment Facility did not create an appearance of impropriety, but speaking to a resident of the facility did?

Would it create an appearance of impropriety for a judge to visit a prison? What if the judge spoke to an inmate?

Would it create an appearance of impropriety for a judge to speak with a person who had a pending civil action?

What should the judge have done to learn about volitional control among inmates civilly committed as sexually violent predators, other than speaking to inmates directly?
