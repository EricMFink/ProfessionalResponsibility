_7.3: Attorney Misconduct_

_Walking the line, you were a marksman. Told me that law, like wine, is ageless. Public defender, you had to admit, you wanted the love of a sex offender._[1]

In addition to their disciplinary authority under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 and Model Rule of Professional Conduct 3.1, courts have the "inherent authority” to regulate the conduct of attorneys and punish attorney misconduct. This inherent authority is recognized by both state and federal courts, and is not derived from any particular state or rule. Rather, it is a function of the need for courts to "manage their own affairs.” As the Supreme Court observed in [_Chambers v. Nasco, Inc._, 501 U.S. 32 (1991)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12894484016394117131):

> It has long been understood that certain implied powers must necessarily result to our Courts of justice from the nature of their institution, powers which cannot be dispensed with in a Court, because they are necessary to the exercise of all others. For this reason, Courts of justice are universally acknowledged to be vested, by their very creation, with power to impose silence, respect, and decorum, in their presence, and submission to their lawful mandates. These powers are governed not by rule or statute but by the control necessarily vested in courts to manage their own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.

The inherent authority of a court is non-exclusive of any statutes or rules that prohibit the same or similar conduct, and courts may use their inherent authority to punish conduct that would fall outside the scope of otherwise applicable statutes of rules. Among other things, courts can use their inherent authority to punish attorneys for conduct that is abusive, vexatious or in bad faith. For example, as the Supreme Court observed in _Chambers_:

> A court may assess attorney’s fees when a party has acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons. In this regard, if a court finds that fraud has been practiced upon it, or that the very temple of justice has been defiled, it may assess attorney’s fees against the responsible party, as it may when a party shows bad faith by delaying or disrupting the litigation or by hampering enforcement of a court order. The imposition of sanctions in this instance transcends a court’s equitable power concerning relations between the parties and reaches a court’s inherent power to police itself, thus serving the dual purpose of vindicating judicial authority without resort to the more drastic sanctions available for contempt of court and making the prevailing party whole for expenses caused by his opponent's obstinacy.

[_Lee v. American Eagle Airlines, Inc._, 93 F. Supp. 2d 1322 (S.D. Fla. 2000)_](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18422616841756190256)

MIDDLEBROOKS, District Judge.

_Summary:_ Marvin and Ira Kurzban represented Anthony Lee in an employment discrimination action against American Eagle Airlines, alleging racial discrimination. The found for Lee on his hostile work environment claim and awarded him $300,000 in compensatory damages and $650,000 in punitive damages, but denied Lee’s claim for termination on account of his race. The Kurzbans filed a motion seeking $1,611,910.50 in attorney’s fees and costs. The district court criticized their conduct during the trial, and relied on its inherent authority to award only $312,324.63 in attorney’s fees and costs. In addition, it reported their conduct to the Florida Bar.

This Cause came before the Court upon Plaintiff’s Amended Verified Motion for Attorney’s Fees and Costs.

I. Introduction

"Let's kick some ass,” Marvin Kurzban said loudly to his client, Anthony Lee, and his co-counsel, Ira Kurzban. I had taken the bench, and Court was in session. Opposing counsel and their client representatives were seated across the aisle. The jury was waiting to be called into the courtroom. Mr. Kurzban’s comment was suited more to a locker room than a courtroom of the United States, and the conduct of Plaintiff’s counsel that followed disrupted the adversary system and interfered with the resolution of a civil dispute.

The trial of this case lasted approximately fourteen days. The jury found that American Eagle Airlines had subjected Mr. Lee to a racially hostile work environment. As compensation, the jury awarded Mr. Lee $300,000. In addition, the jury awarded Mr. Lee $650,000 in punitive damages. The jury denied Mr. Lee’s other claim, finding that Mr. Lee had not been terminated because of his race. This motion seeking attorney’s fees and costs followed.

As the prevailing party in a Title VII action, the Plaintiff now seeks $1,611,910.50 in attorney’s fees. This request presents the question of whether unprofessional and disruptive conduct of counsel which prolongs the proceedings and creates animosity which interferes with the resolution of a cause can be considered in determining an award of attorney’s fees.

In their post-trial motions, counsel for the parties filed opposing affidavits concerning additional misconduct that was not directly observed by the Court. Since these affidavits presented vastly different versions of events, an evidentiary hearing was held; counsel and other witnesses testified.

These issues have been distasteful and time consuming. There is a great temptation to simply move on and ignore the issue. It is unpleasant to hear lawyers accusing each other of lies and misrepresentations. Unprofessionalism on the part of lawyers is a distraction and takes time away from other pending cases; it also embroils the Court in charges and counter charges. However, the functioning of our adversary system depends upon being able to rely upon what a lawyer says. So, confronted by affidavits of counsel that were directly contradictory, I decided to hear testimony and make credibility findings. These findings are based upon direct observations by the Court, the transcript of the trial, and the evidentiary hearing.

In addition, we contacted the Florida Bar to determine whether counsel had been the subject of complaints regarding unprofessional conduct. The Florida Bar forwarded a record of a previous complaint by a state court judge concerning the conduct of Marvin Kurzban. In response to that complaint, and immediately before the trial in this cause, the Florida Bar had directed Mr. Kurzban to attend an ethics class and pay a fine.

II\. Findings of Fact Pertaining to Misconduct by Counsel

Discovery in this case was rancorous from the beginning. As is often the case, counsel for both sides contributed to the lack of civility. The tone of depositions was harsh, witnesses were treated with discourtesy, and discovery disputes were abundant. The transcripts of the depositions in this case are weighted down with bitter exchanges between the lawyers.

Testimony at the evidentiary hearing reflected that this uncivil conduct also continued during conversations between counsel. The testimony of a young lawyer formerly with the Defendant's counsel’s law firm was particularly poignant. This lawyer testified that during telephone conversations with Ira Kurzban, she was hung up on, told that she had only been assigned to work on the case because she was African-American, and wrongly accused of misrepresentations. She testified that her experience with opposing counsel in this case was a factor in her decision to leave her litigation practice.

This testimony was not only powerful and credible, but it also reflects the corrosive impact this type of unprofessional behavior can have upon the bar itself. A litigation practice is stressful and often exhausting. Unprofessional litigation tactics affect everyone exposed to such behavior and the ripple effect of incivility is spread throughout the bar.

The trial began. Testimony at the evidentiary hearing reveals that Mr. Kurzban’s "Let’s kick some ass” comment was not an aberration. A client representative of the Defendant, a lawyer for American Airlines, testified that she and others were subjected to a barrage of comments out of the hearing of the Court and jury which she likened to trash talk at a sporting event. Local counsel for the Defendant was called a "Second Rate Loser” by Marvin Kurzban. She testified that each day as court began, Marvin Kurzban would say, "Let the pounding begin.” In front of defense counsel’s client, Mr. Kurzban would ask, "How are you going to feel when I take all of your client's money?” When walking out of the courtroom, Marvin Kurzban would exclaim, "Yuppies out of the way.”

Other than Mr. Kurzban’s opening comment, I was unaware of this conduct towards opposing counsel and their client’s representatives, although counsel for the Defendants alluded to it during the trial. However, I observed continuing misconduct during the trial itself.

Early in the trial, an episode occurred when defense counsel brought to the Court’s attention that after an instruction to a witness not to discuss his testimony during a break in his testimony for lunch, Ira and Marvin Kurzban had approached the witness and had a discussion — with an open deposition transcript in hand. Marvin Kurzban responded, "That's a lie.” The Kurzbans then explained that they had the transcript open because they were looking at it, but that they were not talking with the witness about it. Their explanation was that they were talking about where they were going for lunch. I accepted the explanation, but with the observation that it was an exercise of poor judgment. (Tr. 324-325).

Shortly afterward, Marvin Kurzban objected to a question, and I overruled his objection. He continued to argue his point, then he visibly expressed his dismay with the ruling. I asked counsel to approach for a sidebar conference, wherein I advised him that for the third time he had made visible displays of disagreement with rulings by nodding his head or looking upward at the ceiling. I told him to stop that conduct and to cease making speaking objections.

Subsequently, I warned both counsel again; once before the jury, and again at the close of the mornings testimony. Ira Kurzban responded that he was way beyond acrimony with opposing counsel.

After this warning, defense counsel followed the Court’s admonition and refused to respond to provocations from opposing counsel. Later that day, Marvin Kurzban interrupted an appropriate cross-examination and requested a sidebar to accuse counsel of intentionally delaying the examination so that he could not reach a witness.

Despite repeated warnings, Plaintiff’s counsel continued to address comments to opposing counsel rather than to the Court and interject inappropriate comments before the jury.

The belligerence of Plaintiff'’s counsel, particularly Marvin Kurzban, spread like a contagion through the courtroom. On September 22, 1999, I returned to the bench after a luncheon break. Marvin Kurzban wanted to raise a matter prior to the jury’s return.

Mr. Kurzban stated:

> I am concerned about the record, Your Honor. I went over to the ... Mr. Reporter there, when we took the first break, and asked him about the ability to get a page typed. And instead I ended up having names called at me and a confrontation. I only bring it to the Court’s attention because I am concerned about the record being clear. I feel this Court Reporter for whatever reason ... I don't know the gentlemen, never met him before — is either unstable based on his reaction and not competent to be reporting or has some bias.

At the next recess, I asked the Court Reporter what had happened. He indicated that at the break, which was a brief break for him inasmuch as we had a calendar call scheduled during that luncheon break, Marvin Kurzban asked him for a portion of transcript. The reporter responded that he could not produce those pages over the break (because he had to report the calendar call). Marvin Kurzban responded, "What are you here for, just to look pretty?” The Court Reporter responded with an epithet, at which point Marvin Kurzban remarked, "We’re not talking about your family.” Then Mr. Kurzban said, "I guess money talks,” suggesting that since the Defendant was ordering daily copy, the reporter was biased in their favor. At that point, the Court Security Officer intervened.

I required the Court Reporter to apologize for his behavior. Because of the accusation of bias, I arranged for other Court Reporters to cover the remainder of the trial.

I learned that accusations of bias followed any disagreement with positions espoused by Plaintiff’s counsel: "There's no question that he's entitled to it, so it's no — if I understand what Your Honor’s saying, you don’t want it to go in front of the jury for whatever reason.” "Your Honor, I know you’re angry at me, but I hope you’re not taking it out on my client.” "In fact, I think that the Court has exhibited extreme bias in this case and your rulings on objections.” "Well, Your Honor, I respectfully disagree with you, that's for a court of appeals ultimately to decide, but to put a motive on it I think it exhibits a substantial amount of bias on behalf of Your Honor.” "And I concur with what my brother has said. There's been clear animus by this Court to this side.” "I’ve practiced 26 years and I’ve tried over 50 cases, and I’ve won multimillion dollar verdicts on more than a dozen cases. I don’t need for this Court to allow a witness to have his wife introduced. I can’t think of any reason or purpose, other than prejudice, that this Court would allow such an act to occur.”

Disturbing behavior by both Marvin Kurzban and Ira Kurzban occurred repeatedly during the trial. When confronted about their conduct, they would deny that which I had just observed and then lash out in a personal attack. For instance, after I overruled an objection made by Ira Kurzban, Marvin Kurzban laughed. Other examples of their conduct following rulings include Marvin Kurzban tossing a pen; Ira Kurzban exclaiming, "This is outrageous”; the rolling of eyes; exasperated looks at the ceiling; and flailing of arms. I warned counsel about this behavior.

After the episode of Marvin Kurzban laughing at my ruling, I asked counsel to approach the bench. Marvin Kurzban responded: "I didn’t laugh. What I started doing was writing a note, saying to my brother ... I didn't realize I was saying it out loud — we’re not trying his case. That's what the objection was, because he's telling about his problems.” Ira Kurzban then interjected: "I’d like to add, Your Honor, there’s a continuing pattern of conduct we believe shows enormous bias and has turned this trial into a circus-like atmosphere.”

Ira Kurzban then listed a litany of complaints about rulings which he stated should result in a mistrial. (When offered a mistrial, the Plaintiff declined.) Defense counsel and the Court Security officer also heard a laugh.

Shortly thereafter, during a discussion between the Court, Marvin Kurzban, and defense counsel about the admissibility of an exhibit a witness had allegedly drawn during a videotaped deposition but which was not on the Plaintiff’s exhibit list, Ira Kurzban walked to the video machine and begin playing the videotape of the deposition in front of the jury. I directed that the machine be turned off and we took a fifteen minute break.

After the break, defense counsel raised the issue and requested some sanction. I asked Ira Kurzban for an explanation. He responded:

> Mr. Kurzban: Yes, Your Honor. First, Mr. Connor asked me not to tamper with the tape now, because you were going to come out and rule. I assume he didn't have any ex parte communication with you. I’m a little perturbed about the fact that somehow he knew you were coming out to make a ruling, which I was totally unaware. The Court: I think he knew that I was coming back after a 15 minute break. There has been absolutely no contact between me and Mr. Connor or any other lawyer in this case between the time I left the bench 15 minutes ago and when I returned now. Now, is there some reason why you would make that accusation? Ira Kurzban: Yes, Your Honor. The Court: All right. What was it? Ira Kurzban: Mr. Connor said the Judge is going to come out here, he’s going to impose some sanction. That's what Mr. Connor said, Your Honor, you are not here. I'm simply saying that's what Mr. Connor did. I’m not accusing you of anything. We can have the marshal testify that I should not touch the tape because you were going to impose sanctions. The Deputy: No, no. The Court: The marshal is nodding no. Mr. Marshal? The Deputy: No mention of sanctions was ever made.

Mr. Kurzban then stated that he had put the tape into the machine so that it would be ready if needed and that the tape began playing accidentally. I accepted his explanation but stated:

> If I can’t rely on lawyers being able to respect each other and be respected and accept what other people say in the courtroom, this system can’t work. It’s as important to me as whether or not you have a law degree. I’m beginning to really have a problem with what you are telling me is happening, based on what I’m seeing and what others in the courtroom are seeing. So you all really need to think about that.

During a cross-examination concerning how much time the witness spent on various shifts, Marvin Kurzban held a file towards the witness and asked:

> Marvin Kurzban: I have your personnel file (indicating). How many times did you have to work between 1992 and 1994, sir? Do you think it was more than a handful of times?

After an objection, and out of the presence of the jury, I asked Mr. Kurzban for the witness’s personnel file. He responded:

> Marvin Kuzban: Actually, we do have Mr. Blades’s personnel file, when it was produced among all the other personnel files in Miami of the people. I don’t know if that box is here or I left it in the office. I think the personnel files that we were given by counsel is in the office. The Court: So it wasn’t in the folder that you picked up and carried to the stand? Marvin Kurzban: No it wasn’t, Your Honor. The Court: You said, :Mr. Blades, we have your personnel file here!” You believe it is permissible to pick up a file from your desk, carry it to the witness stand and tell the witness "Mr. Blades, we have your personnel file,” and then begin questioning him? You believe that’s appropriate court examination? Marvin Kurzban: I do, on hostile witnesses; on cross-examination, I believe that I’m entitled to have that witness believe I’m going to question him on something whether or not I have that in my hand or not. Yes, I do. The Court: I believe, frankly, that it is inappropriate to make a deliberate misrepresentation to a witness or to ask, implying in your questioning something that is not true. Marvin Kurzban: Neither was I implying something that wasn’t true, nor was I making a misrepresentation. The question was about how many times he worked, Your Honor. The question wasn’t: In your personnel file it says something. I didn't make any such misrepresentation.

Mr. Kurzban insisted that he had the personnel file back at his office. He was asked to produce it and he responded that he would the following day. The file was never produced.

At the end of the trial, defense counsel Connor approached Ira Kurzban and offered his hand in congratulations. Mr. Kurzban refused to shake his hand. The trial ended much like it had begun.

At the evidentiary hearing, Plaintiff's counsel were unrepentent, attacking opposing counsel and accepting no responsibility for their own actions. They argued that the perceived misconduct was only a matter of style and the exercise of first amendment rights. In keeping with that "style,” Marvin Kurzban ended the hearing with the proclamation that he had called his opponent a loser, but not a second-rate loser because, "I don't rate losers.” Mr. Kurzban's testimony reflects that he has no clue about what it means to be a lawyer.

III\. Analysis

Courts presiding over civil rights actions may, in their discretion, award the prevailing party a "reasonable attorney’s fee (including expert fees)” as part of its costs. Although the presiding court has discretion, a prevailing plaintiff is to be awarded attorney’s fees "in all but special circumstances.” This presumption in favor of awarding attorney’s fees is a reflection of Congress’ clear intent to "cast the Title VII plaintiff in the role of ‘a private attorney general,’ vindicating a policy of the highest priority.” By awarding prevailing plaintiffs their attorney’s fees, the section "makes it easier for a plaintiff of limited means to bring a meritorious suit.”

Courts determining attorney’s fee awards begin by determining the "lodestar”: the product of the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation and a reasonable hourly rate for the attorney’s services. This lodestar may then be adjusted for the results obtained.

1\. The reasonable hourly rate

"A reasonable hourly rate is the prevailing market rate in the relevant legal community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skills, experience, and reputation.” The party seeking attorney’s fees, in this case Mr. Lee, bears the burden of producing "satisfactory evidence that the requested rate is in line with prevailing market rates.” To be satisfactory, evidence must consist of "more than the affidavit of the attorney performing the work.”

Prior to adoption of the lodestar formula, the so-called "_Johnson_ factors” governed fee awards. Although the lodestar formula has since displaced the "_Johnson_ factors,” the Eleventh Circuit has permitted district courts to consider the factors in establishing a reasonable hourly rate. Among those factors is the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys and the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly. As explained more fully in the findings of misconduct, the conduct of Ira Kurzban and Marvin Kurzban both during and prior to trial was very troubling. In my estimation, the manner in which a lawyer interacts with opposing counsel and conducts himself before the Court is as indicative of the lawyer’s ability and skill as is mastery of the rules of evidence. Upon review of the trial transcripts and the evidence presented during the evidentiary hearing on attorney conduct and based on observations at trial, I find that the conduct of Ira Kurzban and Marvin Kurzban in the litigation of this case fell far below acceptable standards, especially in light of the $300 hourly rate the attorneys claim. Accordingly, I find "special circumstances” justifying a departure from counsels’ requested rates: Ira Kurzban shall be awarded $150 per hour for his pretrial work and $0 for his trial work; Marvin Kurzban’s rate for this action is $0.

For further support of the above rate reductions, we rely upon our "inherent power” to sanction attorney misconduct. "It is well-established that ‘certain implied powers must necessarily result to our Courts of justice from the nature of their institution,’ powers ‘which cannot be dispensed with in a Court, because they are necessary to the exercise of all others.’ For this reason, ‘Courts of justice are universally acknowledged to be vested, by their very creation, with power to impose silence, respect, and decorum, in their presence, and submission to their lawful mandates.’ These powers are ‘governed not by rule or statute but by the control necessarily vested in courts to manage their own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.’”

Among these powers is the contempt sanction, "which a judge must have and exercise in protecting the due and orderly administration of justice and in maintaining the authority and dignity of the court.” "The inherent power of a court to manage its affairs necessarily includes the authority to impose reasonable and appropriate sanctions upon errant lawyers practicing before it.”

A finding that counsels’ conduct "constituted or was tantamount to bad faith” must precede any sanction levied pursuant to a court’s inherent powers. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit requires that bad faith be shown by (1) "clear evidence” or (2) "harassment or delay or other improper purposes.” Where imposed for the purpose of deterring misconduct rather than remedying some prejudice, as here, the District of Columbia Circuit has held that sanctions must be supported by "clear and convincing evidence” of "flagrant or egregious misconduct.” Before imposing a severe sanction based on principles of deterrence, a district court must consider whether a lesser sanction is more proportionate to the misconduct.

In this case, we are imposing a lesser sanction. We did not dismiss this case, but rather permitted it to go the jury. Moreover, although counsel were warned during the trial that further disruptive conduct would be a basis for criminal contempt, that sanction was not employed. We have also elected not to deny Plaintiff’s fee request altogether, though we are reducing it significantly. Additionally, our sanction is supported by "clear and convincing” evidence of "flagrant or egregious” misconduct demonstrating counsels’ "bad faith.” In assessing attorney misconduct, the Court had the benefit of an exhaustive evidentiary hearing concerning attorney misconduct and trial transcripts replete with examples of unprofessional behavior. Most significantly, much of the misconduct in this matter occurred before the Court. Plaintiff’s counsels’ continued misbehavior in the face of repeated verbal reprimands and warnings that the Court intended to revisit counsels' misconduct at a later date demonstrated counsels’ "bad faith.”

There is precedent for denying a party attorney’s fees to which it was otherwise statutorily entitled as a sanction for attorney misconduct. In _Litton Sys., Inc. v. American Tel. and Tel. Co._, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s denial of attorney’s fees to a prevailing plaintiff in an antitrust suit. The plaintiff was entitled to its costs and fees under, among other provisions, the Clayton Act. Though the _Litton_ court based its decision on its power to sanction disobedience of court orders under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b), it noted that "given the court’s express findings of bad faith, it could also have imposed sanctions on the plaintiff as an exercise of its inherent powers.”

In addition, the Court reduces the rates sought by Plaintiff for associate work. Magistrate Judge Barry L. Garber recently found, by order dated May 5, 1999, that $125 was a reasonable hourly rate for associates. Magistrate Judge Stephen T. Brown, in a recommendation dated August 17, 1999, noted that the parties agreed to an hourly rate of $125 for associates. Accordingly, the Court finds that $125 is the prevailing hourly rate in the Southern District for associate work. Thus, the work of Brian Torres, Raquel Libman, Jed Kurzban, and Florence Zolin shall be billed at a rate of $125 per hour. Peter Hoffer, who has eight years of civil rights litigation experience, shall be billed at $175.

2\. The number of hours reasonably expended

Defendant argues that not all of the 3,269.54 hours claimed by Plaintiff were "reasonably expended." Specifically, Defendant contends that Plaintiff claims hours from another case, which are not compensable in this matter, and that Plaintiff did not exercise proper billing judgment.

i\. Hours spent on another case

Defendant points out that although Plaintiff initiated the action before this Court on March 21, 1997, Plaintiff has submitted time records with dates as early as August 1994. Defendant surmises that many of these entries are for work done on other cases and thus are not compensable. Plaintiff replies that the Kurzban firm had begun representing Mr. Lee in 1994, before the firm’s formal retention by Mr. Lee and commencement of this action, and that the work underlying these entries was the basis for Plaintiff’s hostile environment claim. Initially, Ira Kurzban represents that he advised Mr. Lee and other black mechanics at American Eagle who complained of racism at American Eagle, then Flagship Airlines. Thereafter, Mr. Kurzban assisted Plaintiff in his negotiations with American Eagle and in his claims before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

Kurzban, Kurzban et al. may collect fees for legal services it provided Mr. Lee prior to commencement of this action or its formal retention by Mr. Lee. Defendant does not seem to contest this, but rather asks the Court to strike those hours it claims were clearly not spent on matters related to this case.

We begin by striking those entries, dated prior to the commencement of this action, that appear to relate to motions practice and other matters in a pending lawsuit or which do not seem sufficiently related to this action. These entries add up to 137.15 hours. In addition, the Court reduces by 50% the remaining hours claimed between August 10, 1994 and January 2, 1997. We find Plaintiff’s documentation to be inadequate for purposes of demonstrating that these hours were reasonably expended in the litigation of this matter. While the information gathered at this stage was likely helpful in the eventual litigation of Mr. Lee’s claims, the information was being gathered for other purposes. Accordingly, the Court is not convinced that all the time claimed, or even most of it, was reasonably expended in the pursuit of Mr. Lee’s claims.

ii Billing judgment

Fee applicants must exercise "billing judgment.” That means that they must exclude from their fee applications "excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary hours,” which are hours "that would be reasonable to bill to a client and therefore to one’s adversary irrespective of the skill, reputation or experience of counsel.” Defendant maintains that further reductions are warranted based on Plaintiff's counsels’ time and record keeping practices. Vague entries, according to Defendant, preclude the Court from determining that hours were reasonably expended, and cannot be cured by Plaintiff’s counsel’s post hoc, hand-written notes. Defendant also contests counsels’ repetitious charges, claims for hours spent by attorneys "getting up to speed,” and excessive time spent on certain activities.

While wary of counsels’ after-the-fact, clarifying notes, the Court does not ignore the added detail and takes counsel at their word that the additions are supported by reference to red books, pertinent files, and their own memories. The Court is more concerned about the excessive number of hours billed in this case in light of its nature. This case involved racial harassment endured by a single plaintiff at a single site of employment. Although this matter was hotly contested, due in large part to overzealousness on both sides, the $1,611,910.50 in fees sought by Plaintiff's counsel based on 3,269.54 hours is clearly excessive. This view is supported by a review of recent awards in employment discrimination cases in the Southern District, which the Court may consider under _Johnson_. This case was not so much more lengthy or complex than these cases to justify such a grossly disproportionate award. Indeed, Judge Hurley, following a eight-day trial, awarded $191,524.75 in attorneys’ fees. The award followed a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff on her sexually hostile work environment and retaliation claims.

To account for the excessive number of hours claimed in this case, we reduce Plaintiff’s counsels’ hours by 40% across-the-board. In addition, the Court reduces by one-third Ira Kurzban’s non-contemporaneous October 8, 1998 entry, allotting 30 hours to the reading of "all new 11th Circuit cases on employment discrimination related to case” over the past six months.

3\. The lodestar figure

i\. Reasonable hours

For the period August 10, 1994 to January 2, 1997, after deleting hours unrelated to this litigation, the Court recognizes 106.4 hours. We then reduce that figure by 50%, as explained above, for Plaintiff's failure to establish that those hours were spent on matters sufficiently related to this litigation, leaving 53.2 hours. All but one of these hours was billed to Brian Torres or Raquel Libman; the other hour was billed to Ira Kurzban. For the period January 2, 1997 to September 14, 1999, the date the trial began, we recognize the following hours: 1,879.85 hours for Ira Kurzban; 682.24 hours for Raquel Libman; 669.2 hours for Peter Hoffer; 28.6 hours for Jed Kurzban; and 12 hours for Florence Zolin. Finally, for the trial period, we credit 81.7 hours to Jed Kurzban.

Next the Court cuts counsels’ hours by 40% across-the-board for the period January 2, 1997 through trial, having found, upon review of counsels’ billing records and other employment discrimination cases in the District, counsels’ claimed hours to be excessive:

- Ira Kurzban: 1,879.85 × .6 = 1,127.91 hours

- Raquel Libman: 682.24 × .6 = 409.34 hours

- Peter Hoffer: 669.2 × .6 = 401.52 hours

- Jed Kurzban: (28.6 + 81.7) × .6 = 66.18 hours

- Florence Zolin: 12 × .6 = 7.2 hours

ii\. Multiplied by the reasonable hourly rates

> Associates: 534.92\[13\] × $125 = $66,865 Peter Hoffer: 401.52 × $175 = $70,266 Ira Kurzban: 1,128.91\[14\] × $150 = $169,336.50 Final lodestar: $306,467.50

4\. The results obtained

As noted above, the lodestar may then be adjusted for the results obtained. This factor is particularly important where, as here, Plaintiff is deemed "prevailing” even though he succeeded on only one of his claims for relief.

The Court finds that as in many civil rights cases, Plaintiff’s claims involve a common core of facts and related legal theories. Accordingly, the Court does not treat Plaintiff’s suit as a series of discrete claims, readily separated for purposes of apportioning hours between prevailing and non-prevailing claims. Rather, the Court focuses on the overall results achieved by Plaintiff in relation to the hours reasonably expended by Plaintiff’s counsel on the litigation. Having done this, the Court finds that Plaintiff achieved only limited success, rendering the product of the hours reasonably expended on the litigation as a whole and the reasonable hourly rates an excessive fee recovery. While Plaintiff’s recovery on his hostile environment claim was significant, he was unable to convince the jury that he had been discharged based on his race. Moreover, the Court dismissed on summary judgment Plaintiff’s claims for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, as well as his state civil rights claims. At trial, the Court granted Defendant’s Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law on Plaintiff’s claims of negligent training, retention, and supervision. Even though Plaintiff’s claims were "interrelated, nonfrivolous, and raised in good faith,” we may reduce the lodestar to account for his limited success.

For guidance in reducing the lodestar, we turn to _Bohen v. City of E. Chicago_, a case involving similar facts: plaintiff prevailed on her sexual harassment claim, but failed on her discriminatory discharge claim. Judge Easterbrook, sitting by designation, reduced the plaintiff’s fees to account for her limited success, but did so only by 10% across-the-board. He noted that the same witnesses dealt with both aspects of the case and that since the claimed harassment was extensive, it would have been necessary to examine the plaintiff’s whole period of employment even without the discharge claim. Noting that at least some time was spent solely on the discharge claim, though he could not say precisely how much, Judge Easterbrook concluded that the plaintiff’s counsel would have spent about 90% of the time it did had there been no discharge claim. The same reasoning applies here. However, the Court awards Plaintiff 80% of the lodestar, estimating that 20% of Plaintiff's counsels’ time was devoted exclusively to the discharge claim. Specifically, the Court finds that significant time was spent by Plaintiff examining Defendant’s alleged early release program, which was only tangentially related to the hostile environment claim.

Final lodestar figure adjusted for results obtained: $306,467.50 × .8 = $245,174

IV\. Costs

The Court recognizes that the traditional limits on what costs may be taxed, do not apply to requests submitted under § 1988 and that the Eleventh Circuit traditionally takes a liberal approach when reimbursing attorney expenses. However, Plaintiff still bears the burden of submitting a request for expenses that would enable the Court to determine what expenses were incurred and whether Plaintiff is entitled to them. Plaintiff's entries for photocopy, telephone, and fax charges are wholly devoid of explanation. The Court has no way of knowing whether the rates paid for the photocopies were reasonable or even whether these expenses were related to this action. Therefore, the Court will not tax these costs or others that lack description. Moreover, the Court finds that the costs incurred prior to commencement of the action are not taxable.

Having deleted expenses associated with the above-described entries, we tax $67,150.63 as costs.

V. Conclusion

As I considered this issue, I reflected upon a letter recently received from a trial lawyer following a discussion on civility and professionalism with the Miami Chapter of the American Board of Trial Advocates. This lawyer stated:

> It seems to me that the courts are basically facing this issue as one of education. Hence we have seminars, guidelines and articles from both that state and federal bench explaining what lawyers should do to be civil and professional to each other. However, I do not think that problem is that lawyers do not know how to act in a civil manner. Rather, I think some lawyers will simply do that with which they can get away. Special masters, grievance committees and educational seminars are not as effective as a sanction for uncivil behavior. I know our federal court is quite busy and that the time it takes to consider uncivil behavior may have to be taken from some other pending case. However, I would submit that eliminating uncivil behavior not only helps that case, but every other case in which that lawyer is involved. Moreover, as the word spreads as to the price to be paid for unprofessionalism, other lawyers and other cases will be implicated.

I believe that this reduction in attorney fees is an appropriate response to the conduct by Plaintiff’s counsel in this case, but I am not convinced it will deter future misconduct. I frankly considered denying fees altogether but while I have reviewed many of the depositions, I did not observe everything that happened during the pretrial phase of the case. The reduction in attorneys’ fees based upon misconduct of counsel is therefore approximately $358,423.20.

For the foregoing reasons, it is hereby ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that Plaintiff's Amended Verified Motion for Attorney's Fees and Costs is GRANTED. Based on the foregoing we award Plaintiff $312,324.63 in fees and costs.

Furthermore, because of the misconduct of counsel which occurred in this case, a copy of this order shall be sent to the Florida Bar and the Peer Review Committee for the Southern District of Florida for any action deemed appropriate.

_Questions:_

1. [This article](https://nypost.com/2000/11/12/recount-case-judges-gave-to-dems/) from the New York Post provides some additional information about the case and the judge. Marvin Kurzban and [Ira J. Kurzban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ira_J._Kurzban) were partners in a [Florida law firm](https://www.kktplaw.com/Attorneys/). Marvin Kurzban was disciplined by the Florida Bar for his conduct in this action. In 2019, another disciplinary complaint was filed against him, for violating an evidentiary ruling and insulting the judge and opposing counsel. He petitioned for disciplinary revocation without leave for readmission, and is currently [disbarred](https://www.floridabar.org/directories/find-mbr/profile/?num=128057) in Florida. Ira Kurzban is still practicing, teaches immigration law at the University of Miami School of Law as an adjunct professor, and is the author of [_Kurzban’s Immigration Law Sourcebook_](https://agora.aila.org/product/detail/3635).

2. Was the court justified in criticizing the conduct of Marvin and Ira Kurzban? Does it matter that they won? Does it matter that the jury imposed substantial punitive damages on the defendant?

3. Was the court justified in reducing the attorney’s fees and costs award? If so, did it go too far or not far enough? Could the court have denied attorney’s fees and costs altogether?

[Ophelia F. Camiña](https://www.susmangodfrey.com/attorneys/ophelia-f-camina/)

[_Positive Software Solutions v. New Century Mortg._, 619 F. 3d 458 (5th Cir. 2010)_](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18444619385521208851)

_Summary:_ Positive Software filed an infringement action against New Century, which was represented by Camiña. The district court sent the action to arbitration, then vacated the award, because the arbitrator failed to disclose a previous relationship with Camiña. The circuit court reversed and remanded, at which point New Century declared bankruptcy, and the parties settled. As part of the settlement, New Century assigned its attorney-client privilege and work product rights to Positive Software, which moved for sanctions against Camiña, based on her actions in the arbitration. The district court exercised its inherent authority and imposed a $10,000 sanction for acting in bad faith, but the circuit court reversed, holding that actions in arbitration are outside the inherent authority of the court.

JERRY E. SMITH, Circuit Judge:

Ophelia Camiña appeals the district court’s imposition of sanctions for her conduct during arbitration. Because that court lacked inherent authority to impose those sanctions, we reverse and remand.

I.

In 2003, Positive Software Solutions, Inc., sued New Century Mortgage Corporation for allegedly infringing telemarketing software licensed to New Century. Ophelia Camiña, a partner at Susman Godfrey LLP, appeared as attorney for New Century. Over Positive Software’s objection, the district court ordered the case to arbitration in accordance with the parties’ contract.

During arbitration, Camiña advised New Century on various discovery matters. In September 2004, the district court vacated the award because the arbitrator had failed to disclose his previous professional relationship with Camiña. This court reversed the vacatur and remanded.

After remand, New Century declared bankruptcy. In the course of the bankruptcy proceedings, Positive Software settled its claims against New Century, and the case was administratively closed. Under the settlement, New Century waived and assigned to Positive Software its attorney-client and work-product rights. The district court granted Positive Software’s demand that Susman Godfrey LLP turn over its files for use by Positive Software in pursuing sanctions.

In March 2008, Positive Software moved for sanctions against Camiña, Barry Barnett, and Susman Godfrey LLP under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37, 28 U.S.C. § 1927, and the court’s inherent authority. In February 2009, using its purported inherent authority, the court sanctioned Camiña $10,000, representing a portion of Positive Software's attorneys’ fees. Camiña appeals the sanction.

III\.

Camiña claims that the district court lacked inherent authority to impose sanctions for her conduct during arbitration. In the alternative, she argues that the court employed the wrong standard of proof in finding that she acted in bad faith, and that the sanctions were not supported by the evidence. Because the court lacked inherent authority to sanction Camiña for her actions during arbitration, we need not address her alternative claims.

A.

A district court has the inherent authority to impose sanctions "in order to control the litigation before it.” The court may also use that power to sanction conduct, if it is "in direct defiance of the sanctioning court,” or constitutes "disobedience to the orders of the Judiciary,” Inherent power, however, "may be exercised only if essential to preserve the authority of the court.”

In _Maxxam_, we confirmed the limited reach of the court’s inherent authority. There the FDIC sued Charles Hurwitz, alleging that he was responsible for the failure of a savings and loan association. The FDIC also encouraged the Office of Thrift Supervision to pursue similar claims in an administrative proceeding. The FDIC moved that the district court stay its case pending completion of the OTS proceeding. When the district court denied that motion, the FDIC continued to support the administrative action. Invoking its inherent powers, the court sanctioned the FDIC for Hurwitz’s expenses in defending the OTS action. We reversed part of those sanctions on the ground that the inherent power does not extend to collateral proceedings that "do not threaten the court’s own judicial authority or proceedings.” Inherent authority "is not a broad reservoir of power, ready at an imperial hand, but a limited source; an implied power squeezed from the need to make the court function.”

Here the district court distinguished _Maxxam_, positing that arbitration is not a collateral proceeding but instead an "annex” to litigation. It reasoned that because the court ordered the parties to arbitrate, it retained the authority to impose sanctions for conduct committed in arbitration. That approach is puzzling. To begin with, arbitration is not an annex to litigation, but an alternative method for dispute resolution. Treating arbitration as if it were an appendage to adjudication is a mistake that would undermine the very purpose of arbitration — "the provision of a relatively quick, efficient and informal means of private dispute settlement.” Parties agree to arbitration to avoid litigation; they voluntarily surrender judicial remedies in favor of an extrajudicial process.

Furthermore, the notion that the court’s inherent authority turns on whether the arbitration was "court-ordered” is untenable. Positive Software claims that the district court retained significant supervisory authority by virtue of ordering the parties to arbitrate. When asked, in oral argument, whether the court would have had inherent authority to sanction Camiña if the parties had chosen to enter arbitration at the outset, Positive Software’s counsel candidly stated, "of course not — that’s _Maxxam_.” Positive Software’s distinction, then, would allow trial courts to oversee arbitrations in which one party had to be compelled to arbitrate but not those in which both parties complied with their arbitration agreement. Such a significant and perverse asymmetry cannot be justified, and Positive Software’s efforts to distinguish this case from _Maxxam_ are unavailing.

In an attempt to rescue the sanctions order, Positive Software additionally claims that the sanctions are based on Camiña’s direct defiance of the preliminary injunction and protective order. That assertion, however, is belied by the court’s own explicit explanation that the sanctioned conduct "took place in connection with the arbitration, not in connection with discovery under the Court's supervision.” In other words, the court imposed sanctions not on account of any direct violation of a court order, but only because it found that Camiña had exhibited four particular instances of bad faith during arbitration.

Positive Software’s argument, therefore, fails according to the court’s own findings. Because Camiña’s conduct was neither before the district court nor in direct defiance of its orders, the conduct is beyond the reach of the court’s inherent authority to sanction.

B.

Not only are the sanctions at odds with our caselaw on inherent authority, but they also are in serious tension with the Federal Arbitration Act. Under the FAA, the district court has the authority to determine (1) whether arbitration should be compelled, and (2) whether an arbitration award should be confirmed, vacated, or modified. Beyond those narrowly defined procedural powers, the court has no authority to interfere with an arbitration proceeding. Because both parties agree that their contract gave the arbitrator authority to sanction Camiña for bad-faith conduct, the FAA counsels against the district court’s assigning itself that task.

Positive Software cites _LaPrade v. Kidder Peabody & Co._, to resolve the apparent tension between the sanction order and the FAA. In _LaPrade_, the district court stayed an action brought by Linda LaPrade against her former employer because the dispute was covered by a valid arbitration agreement. While the arbitration was pending, LaPrade’s attorney went into state court and obtained an ex parte order staying the arbitration without informing that court of the district court’s previous order. On the employer’s motion, the district court lifted the state court’s stay and imposed sanctions against LaPrade’s attorneys under 28 U.S.C. § 1927 for their "vexatious and dilatory tactics.” On appeal, the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the sanctions, concluding that the FAA did not divest the district court of jurisdiction to enter the sanctions order.

_LaPrade_, however, does not support the district court's exercise of inherent power against Camiña. First, _LaPrade_ held only that the FAA does not affect the district court’s jurisdiction over a case stayed pending arbitration. But jurisdiction alone does not create the inherent power to sanction arbitration conduct. That power must be grounded in some threat to the court’s authority or its ability to function and must not be contrary to statute. Unlike the court in _LaPrade_, which involved sanctions under a specific statutory provision, the district court here relied only on its inherent authority, which, as noted, was not up to the task.

Furthermore, it is misleading to suggest that LaPrade’s attorneys were sanctioned for conduct in arbitration. Instead, the court imposed sanctions for the direct violation of its order. In staying the federal suit, the court mandated that LaPrade seek redress of her employment-related grievances only through arbitration. By obtaining a stay of arbitration in state court, her attorneys disregarded that order, thereby posing a threat to the federal district court’s authority. That conduct might have been analogous to what happened here if Camiña’s sanctions had rested on her violation of the preliminary injunction or the protective order. But as already discussed, the district court found no such violation.

C.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the sanctions order threatens unduly to inflate the judiciary’s role in arbitration. The FAA provides for minimal judicial involvement in resolving an arbitrable dispute; the court is limited to only a few narrowly defined, largely procedural tasks. But by using its power to sanction, a court could seize control over substantive aspects of arbitration. The court would, in effect, become a roving commission to supervise a private method of dispute resolution and exert authority that is reserved, by statute, caselaw, and long-standing practice, to the arbitrator. That supervision is inconsistent with the scope of inherent authority and with federal arbitration policy, which aims to prevent courts from delaying the resolution of disputes through alternative means.

In response, Positive Software claims that expansion of district court authority is necessary here, because Positive Software did not discover some of Camiña’s alleged misdeeds until after the case had been settled and administratively closed. Positive Software argues that without the district court’s assertion of inherent authority, there would have been no means to redress Camiña's supposed wrongdoing. That argument, however, ignores at least two other procedures that were available to Positive Software.

First, it could have asked the American Arbitration Association to re-open the proceedings so it could request sanctions from the arbitrator. Second, it could have relied on the grievance process. In fact, it did: Its counsel filed a grievance against Camiña, which was dismissed as lacking just cause. Contrary to Positive Software’s contentions, then, there was no particular need for the district court to expand its inherent authority to prevent misdeeds from falling through the cracks.

IV\.

In sum, the district court lacked inherent authority to sanction Camiña for her conduct during arbitration. That conduct was neither before the district court nor in direct defiance of its orders. If inherent authority were expanded to cover Camiña’s conduct, there would be nothing to prevent courts from inserting themselves into the thicket of arbitrable issues — precisely where they do not belong. Such an expansion would also threaten the integrity of federal arbitration law in the name of filling a gap that does not exist. We therefore REVERSE the sanctions[2] and REMAND for any further proceedings that may be needed.

_Questions:_

1. Why did the circuit court hold that Camiña’s conduct was outside the scope of the district court’s inherent authority? Why didn’t it matter that the district court had sent the action to arbitration?

2. The district court had the authority to review at least some aspects of the arbitration. Why didn’t that place Camiña’s conduct during the arbitration within the scope of its inherent authority?

3. Notably, New Century was a subsidiary of [New Century Financial Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Century), a real estate investment trust, and one of the largest issuers of subprime mortgages. When New Century filed for bankruptcy in 2007, it signaled the beginning of the subprime mortgage crisis.

_Summary:_ Porky’s was a topless bar outside of DeLand, Florida. When Volusia County passed an ordinance prohibiting topless bars, Porky’s challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance, represented by Latinsky and Fendt. The standard of review of the ordinance depended on whether Florida had delegated its powers under the 21st Amendment to counties and municipalities. In _City of Daytona Beach v. Del Percio_, the Florida Supreme Court held that it had, but Latinsky and Fendt argued that it hadn’t, and did not cite _Del Percio_. The district court sanctioned them under Rule 11 for intentionally failing to cite controlling adverse precedent and the circuit court affirmed.

PER CURIAM:

The appellants, attorneys Eric Latinsky and Fred Fendt, were sanctioned by the district court pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 for failing to cite adverse, controlling precedent in a memorandum filed in support of an application for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. In the appellants’ initial appeal to this court, the case was remanded to the district court because the court had failed to notify the attorneys in advance that it was considering sanctions, and did not give them an opportunity to respond. On remand, the district court reaffirmed the imposition of sanctions, and the attorneys appeal. We affirm.

Appellants filed an application in the district court for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction on behalf of their clients, who own and operate a lounge known as "Porky’s.” In support of the application, appellants filed a memorandum of law which challenged the validity of a Volusia County ordinance prohibiting nude or semi-nude entertainment in commercial establishments at which alcoholic beverages are offered for sale or consumption. The memorandum failed to discuss or cite two clearly relevant cases: _City of Daytona Beach v. Del Percio_ and _New York State Liquor Authority v. Bellanca_. We find that this failure supports the imposition of Rule 11 sanctions in the circumstances of this case.

The field of law concerning the regulation of the sale and consumption of alcohol in connection with nude entertainment is a narrow and somewhat specialized field. Prior to the opinion of the Supreme Court of Florida in _Del Percio_, the critical question of whether the state of Florida had delegated its powers under the Twenty-First Amendment to counties and municipalities had gone unanswered. In some circles, that decision was long-awaited. If the state had delegated the authority, local ordinances regulating the sale or consumption of alcohol would be entitled to a presumption in favor of their validity which is conferred by the Twenty-First Amendment. If the state had not delegated the authority, the ordinances would be subject to the stricter review applicable to exercises of the general police power.

The question regarding Florida’s delegation of its powers under the Twenty-First Amendment was answered by the Supreme court of Florida in _Del Percio_, a case in which one of the appellants, Latinsky, participated. The court held that the powers had been delegated. Less than one year later, on or about January 13, 1986, Latinsky and an associate brought the instant suit seeking a declaration that a similar ordinance was unconstitutional and requesting a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction. In their presentation to the court, the appellants cited a number of cases describing the limits on the exercise of the general police power. However, they did not advise the court in any way that _Del Percio_ had been decided, despite the fact that _Del Percio_ required that the validity of the ordinance be judged in light of powers retained under the Twenty-First Amendment rather than the general police power.

The appellants purported to describe the law to the district court in the hope that the description would guide and inform the court’s decision. With apparently studied care, however, they withheld the fact that the long-awaited decision by the Supreme Court of Florida had been handed down. This will not do. The appellants are not redeemed by the fact that opposing counsel subsequently cited the controlling precedent. The appellants had a duty to refrain from affirmatively misleading the court as to the state of the law. They were not relieved of this duty by the possibility that opposing counsel might find and cite the controlling precedent, particularly where, as here, a temporary restraining order might have been issued ex parte.

In this court, appellants argue that the cases were not cited because they are not controlling. We certainly acknowledge that attorneys are legitimately entitled to press their own interpretations of precedent, including interpretations which render particular cases inapplicable. It is clear, however, that appellants’ attempts to show that _Del Percio_ and _Bellanca_ are not controlling are simply post hoc efforts to evade the imposition of sanctions. Neither the original complaint nor the memorandum of law filed by appellants in the district court reflect or support the arguments they now raise. Indeed, it is likely that the arguments were not raised previously because they are completely without merit. In the circumstances of this case, the imposition of Rule 11 sanctions by the district court was warranted. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.

_Questions:_

1. You can read newspaper articles about Porky’s [here](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1986-01-14-0190160128-story.html) and [here](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1986-02-06-0200010028-story.html). After the court’s ruling in 1986, the bar changed to a "bottle club,” where patrons purchased alcohol elsewhere and mixed their own drinks, in order to avoid the ordinance, but soon closed. You can read a newspaper article about the disciplinary case against Latinsky and Fendt case [here](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1986-01-18-0190210059-story.html). The district court accused them of "reprehensible” conduct and imposed a $500 fine. Do you think that is adequate?

2. [Model Rule 3.3(a)(2)](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_3_3_candor_toward_the_tribunal/) provides: "A lawyer shall not knowingly fail to disclose to the tribunal legal authority in the controlling jurisdiction known to the lawyer to be directly adverse to the position of the client and not disclosed by opposing counsel.” Latinsky and Fendt argued that the action challenging the ordinance was in federal court, so the decision of the Florida Supreme Court was not controlling. Should that have excused their failure to cite it? What if the district court had to independently determine whether Florida had delegated its authority?

[_Board of Ethics & Conduct v. Lane_, 642 N.W.2d 296 (Iowa 2002)_](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10062433782212659611)

_Summary:_ Lane represented Sicard in an employment discrimination action. Among other things he filed a post-trial brief, the entire contents of which were plagiarized from a treatise. Lane won the trial, and submitted a bill for attorney’s fees, requesting $16,000 for 80 hours drafting the post-trial brief. When the court requested documentation of the drafting of the brief, Lane eventually submitted a list of 200 sources, from which the court discovered his plagiarism. The court sanctioned Lane’s conduct and suspended his license for 6 months.

STREIT, Justice.

An Iowa attorney passed someone else’s writing as his own and claimed he spent almost two weeks writing that which he used. The Iowa Supreme Court Board of Professional Ethics and Conduct filed a complaint with our Grievance Commission against respondent, William J. Lane, alleging he violated several ethical rules and recommended we suspend Lane’s license to practice law for three months. We agree with the Commission's findings of misconduct but suspend Lane’s license for six months.

I. Background Facts and Proceedings

After the conclusion of a trial in federal court in which Daniel Sicard claimed a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, attorney Lane submitted a post-trial brief to the court. The legal portion of the brief was in great part plagiarized from a treatise written by Barbara Lindemann and Paul Grossman. Lane later applied to the court for attorney fees. Among other charges, Lane requested compensation for eighty hours of work spent to prepare the questioned brief. Charging $200 per hour, Lane asked for $16,000 to write the brief that was largely copied from an uncredited source. In total, Lane requested $104,127 in attorney fees plus $13,363.29 in costs for his representation of Sicard.

On May 5, 1998, there was a hearing on Lane’s attorney fee application. The United States magistrate judge stated it did not appear to him that Lane wrote the legal portions of the brief. Lane responded, "I borrowed liberally from other sources. Yes, your Honor.” The court noted,

> Because of the consistency of style and the sequence of footnotes, the court assumes that the brief is from a particular source. If the source is a published treatise, it can simply be identified by name, author, and publisher.

To address this suspicion, the judge ordered Lane to explain or identify the sources cited in his brief within ten days. At the end of the ten days, Lane did nothing to comply with the court’s order. On June 4, 1998, a member of the judge’s staff asked Lane if he intended to respond to the order. Only days later, a fire at Lane’s home destroyed many of his files and records in the Sicard matter. In July 1998, Lane closed his office, but continued to practice out of his home.

Four months passed and Lane still did not respond to the judge’s order. On September 30, 1998, the judge entered an order awarding Lane $20,000 in fees in the Sicard case. The judge stated "there were many serious problems with plaintiff’s fees and cost claim.” The court was particularly concerned because Lane did not support his contention he was entitled to receive compensation at the rate of $200 per hour for his services. Lane also requested $9000 as compensation for the time he spent preparing his bill. The judge stated Lane requested $16,000 for the lifted brief but failed to comply with the court’s order to "disclose the sources from which counsel ‘borrowed liberally.’” Lane also requested compensation for fifty-nine hours of legal research preceding the trial. The court concluded

> It is not reasonable to bill 59 hours of legal research in the two weeks prior to trial. If counsel spent this amount for time performing research, it is further evidence that he does not possess the skill and experience of those who charge $200 per hour.

The court further explained its reduction of the attorney fees awarded by citing to Lane’s charges of $5.00 per telephone call, $1.00 per page of facsimile transmissions, $191 for long distance transmission, and $.50 per photocopy. Finally, the court stated Lane did not cite authority for the ability to charge for estimated pretrial travel expenses. Lane did not appeal the $20,000 award of attorney fees.

On October 30, 1998, Lane filed a compliance with the judge’s order to document his sources but the judge was not made aware of the compliance until March 1999. When the judge read Lane’s compliance he did not notice any reference to the primary source of the legal portion of Lane’s brief. Lane’s compliance constituted four pages of single-spaced lists of authorities. Among them was the Grossman treatise. However, no particular attention was drawn to this source. Consequently, the judge undertook his own investigation and discovered Lane took the legal portion of his brief verbatim from the Grossman treatise.

This complaint also involves Lane’s representation in two separate and unrelated bankruptcy cases. The Ethics Board charged Lane with, among other violations, neglect of clients’ legal matters, withdrawal from employment without taking reasonable steps to avoid prejudice to his clients and without promptly refunding unearned fees, and failure to seek the lawful objectives of his clients. The Commission found, and we agree, the Ethics Board failed to satisfy its burden to prove Lane violated any ethical rules in representing his clients in the bankruptcy matters. Therefore, we will only address the charges relevant to the Sicard case.

III\. Complaint

The Ethics Board alleges violations of DR 1-102(A)(1), (3), (4), (5), and (6). This rule provides in part, a lawyer shall not:

- Violate a disciplinary rule;

- Engage in illegal conduct involving moral turpitude;

- Engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation;

- Engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; and

- Engage in any other conduct that adversely reflects on the fitness to practice law.

The Ethics Board also charges Lane with a violation of DR 2-106(A) which states, "a lawyer shall not enter into an agreement for, charge, or collect an illegal or clearly excessive fee.” The Commission found Lane violated DR 1-102(A)(1), (3), (4), (5), and (6) and DR 2-106(A) by his handling of the Sicard case.

IV\. Ethical Violations

Lane plagiarized from a treatise and submitted his plagiarized work to the court as his own. This plagiarism constituted, among other things, a misrepresentation to the court. An attorney may not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation. This issue is akin to the matter of ghost-writing attorneys who "author pleadings and necessarily guide the course of the litigation with unseen hand.” In this situation, an attorney authors court documents for a pro se litigant who, in turn, submits the court document as his or her own writing. This practice is widely condemned as unethical and a "deliberate evasion of the responsibilities imposed on attorneys.” Just as ghost writing constitutes a misrepresentation on the court, so does plagiarism of the type we have before us.

Plagiarism itself is unethical. "Plagiarism, the adoption of the work of others as one’s own, does involve an element of deceit, which reflects on an individual's honesty.” Use of "appropriated material cannot go undisciplined, especially because honesty is so fundamental to the functioning of the legal profession.” Undoubtedly, Lane’s plagiarism reflects poorly on both his professional ethics and judgment.

It was not difficult to find similarity between Lane’s post-trial brief and the Grossman treatise. The legal argument of Lane’s post-trial brief consisted of eighteen pages of plagiarized material, including both text and footnotes, from the treatise. In copying this material, Lane cherry-picked the relevant portions and renumbered the footnotes to reflect the altered text. Examination of Lane’s brief does not reveal any independent labor or thought in the legal argument.

On the first occasion plagiarism became an issue, Lane appeared to be forthcoming with the court and admitted "he borrowed liberally from other sources.” It also appears Lane attempted to identify the source of his writing before the court but was unable to recall the exact title of the treatise. Lane later had the chance to identify his source to the court, but when he responded to the court's order, he failed to specifically draw the court's attention to the Grossman treatise. Instead, Lane buried the title within a list of over 200 other sources. Though a technical compliance with the court’s order, Lane’s continued lack of candor indicates he hoped, by concealing the treatise among 200 other titles, the judge would not recognize the extent of Lane’s plagiarism.

We do recognize Lane’s personal circumstances shortly after the time of the court’s order were not ideal. Lane’s home was nearly destroyed by the fire forcing him and his family to live in a motel for two months. However, this does not excuse his failure to comply with the court's order in a timely fashion. We will not excuse the seriousness of passing off another’s work as one’s own. We find the record shows Lane knowingly plagiarized and intended to deceive the court.

Equally troubling is Lane’s application for attorney fees. Lane copied the entire portion of his legal argument out of a book and then claimed it took him eighty hours to write the brief containing the copied material. He requested attorney fees for this work at the rate of $200 per hour. Other than Lane’s assertions that perhaps he works less efficiently than other lawyers, there is little in the record to indicate Lane actually spent this amount of time writing the brief. Because he plagiarized the entire legal argument, the chances are remote that it took Lane eighty hours to write the argument. Rather, the facts show Lane stole all eighteen pages of his legal argument from a single source. Then to justify his request for attorney fees for the eighty hours it took to "write” the brief, Lane submitted a list of over 200 legal sources to the court. In doing so, Lane attempted to have the court believe he researched and relied on each of these sources in writing the brief. These circumstances only support the conclusion Lane endeavored to deceive the court.

The Ethics Board argues Lane's plagiarism was part of a larger scheme to defraud the court by means of inflated time and expense billings. When Lane requested compensation for time he did not spend working on the case, he violated the professional rule forbidding a lawyer from entering into an agreement for, charging, or collecting an illegal or clearly excessive fee. Even after the plagiarism issue arose, Lane continued to assert he was entitled to receive $200 for the eighty hours it took him to copy the material in his brief. He did not at any time admit that it did not take, nor could it have taken him that long to simply copy his legal argument out of a treatise. Charging such a clearly excessive bill brings Lane’s integrity into question and the entire legal profession into disrepute.

It is important to note that Lane’s request for attorney fees in this case is not similar to cases where the attorney is simply not awarded the fee requested. Lane relies on one particular case in which the district court reduced the attorney's fee application of over $171,000 to $95,000. The dispute in _Lynch_ involved the attorney’s expenditure of time, effort, and money in representing her client. There, the trial court properly considered several factors in reducing the award of attorney fees. These factors included: the time necessarily spent; the difficulty of handling and importance of the issues; the responsibility assumed and results obtained; the standing and experience of the attorney in the profession; and the customary charges for similar service. In _Lynch_, there was no suggestion of impropriety or intent to deceive the court on the part of the attorney who submitted the fee application. Moreover, the record contained no evidence to contradict the evidence supporting the fee application.

In many cases a fee application may not necessarily be a precise measure of the time an attorney spent on a particular case. Ethics concerns are not unavoidably raised where the court reduces the attorney fee award merely reflecting considerations that do not bring into question the attorney’s honesty or integrity in submitting the fee application. On the other hand, although ethics is not a matter of degree of misstatement—any knowing misstatement to the court being unethical—the nature and depth of Lane’s misrepresentation speaks of knowing deception.

The record before us amply supports the conclusion Lane’s conduct rises to the level of intent to deceive. Action based in the hopes of deceiving the court are not the same as those arising from simple negligence or even recklessness. A lawyer who knowingly submits a fee application to the court and thereby attempts to misrepresent the amount of time he or she spent working on a case has committed serious ethical violations. Accordingly, we will not treat all of the cases the same. When the fee application involves culpable conduct, the seriousness of the offense will be considered in fashioning the appropriate sanction. We conclude the record supports the Commission’s findings that Lane charged a clearly excessive fee in the _Sicard_ case.

V. Discipline

In determining the proper sanction, we consider the particular facts and circumstances of each case. Among the factors we give weight to are the need for deterrence, protection of the public, maintenance of the reputation of the Bar as a whole, and the violator's fitness to continue to practice law. We also consider any aggravating or mitigating circumstances.

One such aggravating circumstance is a lawyer’s prior disciplinary history. Lane has once before faced attorney disciplinary proceedings. In 1997, the Commission sanctioned Lane for failing to respond to an inquiry. He was publicly reprimanded for conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice and conduct adversely reflecting on his fitness to practice law.

A mitigating factor to consider is Lane’s recognition of some wrongdoing. Lane filed "Respondent’s Statement” with this court. Although not evidence, we will treat this statement as a supplemental brief. Lane stated,

> I can accept that my behavior was the result of bad judgment, ignorance, even stupidity or carelessness, or sloppiness, or any number of things, such as laziness, negligence, arrogance, indolence, pettiness, or just plain old incompetence.

Lane asserted he did not intend to deceive the court and cited his reputation for honesty. In support of this contention, several character witnesses testified on Lane’s behalf at the hearing before the Commission. Despite Lane’s statements to the court, he still does not appear to comprehend the wrongfulness of his actions. In requesting excessive and unreasonable attorney fees for a brief he did not write, Lane was not negligent, or even reckless. Rather, more seriously, he intended to deceive. Lane’s purported acknowledgment of misconduct fails to recognize the full extent of his wrongdoing.

Mitigating factors alone do not overcome our responsibility to the public and to the legal profession. Though Lane offered evidence of difficult personal circumstances, this does not excuse his unethical conduct. Taking all of the above factors into consideration, we conclude in cases of this type, fairness and justice require discipline be imposed to deter future misconduct, protect the public, and maintain the reputation of the Bar as a whole. Lane’s excessive billing for writing a largely plagiarized brief cannot go undisciplined. Honesty is fundamental to the functioning of the legal profession, and Lane’s conduct in this case has compromised that honesty. Moreover, Lane has jeopardized the integrity of the Bar and the public’s trust in the legal profession. We conclude a six-month license suspension is warranted. We therefore suspend Lane’s license to practice law in the State of Iowa, with no possibility of reinstatement for a period of six months from the date of the filing of this opinion. Upon application for reinstatement, Lane shall have the burden to prove he has not practiced law during the period of suspension and that he meets the requirements of Iowa Court Rule 35.13. Any hearing on application for reinstatement shall be at least sixty days after the filing of such application.

_Questions:_

1. Did the court sanction Lane for plagiarizing the contents of the brief, billing for hours he didn’t work, or lack of candor to the court?

2. The court stated that "plagiarism itself is unethical.” Do you agree? Does it depend on the context? The court relied on cases involving law students who plagiarized in coursework. Is that an appropriate comparison?

3. Lane’s plagiarized brief was apparently effective, as he won the case. As Lane’s client, would you have been upset to learn that he plagiarized the brief, if he only billed you for the number of hours he actually spent drafting the brief? Should the court have censured Lane for plagiarism, if he had only billed for the number of hours he actually spent drafting the brief?

4. Why did Lane plagiarize the treatise rather than quoting it? Would citing the treatise have made Lane’s argument weaker or stronger?
