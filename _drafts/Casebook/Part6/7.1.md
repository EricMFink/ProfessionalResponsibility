_7.1: Frivolous Pleadings_

_Meaningless, who dare to say it wasn’t meaningless? Shout from the
rooftops and address the press. Ha ha ha it was totally meaningless._[1]

While courts have always prohibited "frivolous” litigation, they have
also struggled to define it. In theory, frivolous litigation consists of
a pleading or motion that a competent attorney would know has no
legitimate basis in fact or law. But of course, it is often hard to know
whether a legal claim is legitimate or has a chance of success.
Sometimes, courts change their minds, and sometimes, juries are
unpredictable. Frivolity is often in the eye of the beholder.

The Supreme Court has revised the procedural rules governing frivolous
litigation many times, and adopted different approaches to identifying
and dissuading frivolous litigation at different points in time. The
notes of the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure
seem to reflect both frustration with frivolous litigation and
uncertainty about how to prevent it. For example, the 1983 notes
observe, "Experience shows that in practice Rule 11 has not been
effective in deterring abuses.” They accompanied revisions that
encouraged the imposition of sanctions. And the 1993 notes observe,
"Experience shows that in practice Rule 11 has not been effective in
deterring abuses.” They accompanied revisions that discouraged the
imposition of sanctions.

Under the current version of Rule 11, a party may file a motion for
sanctions only after serving the draft motion on opposing counsel and
giving them time to respond. While courts may impose sanctions under
Rule 11 _sua sponte_, the Rule implicitly discourages sanctions and
encourages dispute resolution.

[_Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11: Signing Pleadings, Motions,
and Other Papers; Representations to the Court;
Sanctions_](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_11)

1. Signature. Every pleading, written motion, and other paper must be
 signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorney’s
 name—or by a party personally if the party is unrepresented. The
 paper must state the signer's address, e-mail address, and
 telephone number. Unless a rule or statute specifically states
 otherwise, a pleading need not be verified or accompanied by an
 affidavit. The court must strike an unsigned paper unless the
 omission is promptly corrected after being called to the
 attorney's or party's attention.

2. Representations to the Court. By presenting to the court a pleading,
 written motion, or other paper—whether by signing, filing,
 submitting, or later advocating it—an attorney or unrepresented
 party certifies that to the best of the person’s knowledge,
 information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under
 the circumstances:

 1. it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to
 harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the
 cost of litigation;

 2. the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are warranted
 by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending,
 modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new
 law;

 3. the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if
 specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary
 support after a reasonable opportunity for further
 investigation or discovery; and

 4. the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence
 or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based on
 belief or a lack of information.

3. Sanctions.

 1. In General. If, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to
 respond, the court determines that Rule 11(b) has been
 violated, the court may impose an appropriate sanction on any
 attorney, law firm, or party that violated the rule or is
 responsible for the violation. Absent exceptional
 circumstances, a law firm must be held jointly responsible for
 a violation committed by its partner, associate, or employee.

 2. Motion for Sanctions. A motion for sanctions must be made
 separately from any other motion and must describe the
 specific conduct that allegedly violates Rule 11(b). The
 motion must be served under Rule 5, but it must not be filed
 or be presented to the court if the challenged paper, claim,
 defense, contention, or denial is withdrawn or appropriately
 corrected within 21 days after service or within another time
 the court sets. If warranted, the court may award to the
 prevailing party the reasonable expenses, including attorney's
 fees, incurred for the motion.

 3. On the Court's Initiative. On its own, the court may order an
 attorney, law firm, or party to show cause why conduct
 specifically described in the order has not violated Rule
 11(b).

 4. Nature of a Sanction. A sanction imposed under this rule must be
 limited to what suffices to deter repetition of the conduct or
 comparable conduct by others similarly situated. The sanction
 may include nonmonetary directives; an order to pay a penalty
 into court; or, if imposed on motion and warranted for
 effective deterrence, an order directing payment to the movant
 of part or all of the reasonable attorney's fees and other
 expenses directly resulting from the violation.

 5. Limitations on Monetary Sanctions. The court must not impose a
 monetary sanction:

 1. against a represented party for violating Rule 11(b)(2); or

 2. on its own, unless it issued the show-cause order under Rule
 11(c)(3) before voluntary dismissal or settlement of the
 claims made by or against the party that is, or whose
 attorneys are, to be sanctioned.

 6. Requirements for an Order. An order imposing a sanction must
 describe the sanctioned conduct and explain the basis for the
 sanction.

4. Inapplicability to Discovery. This rule does not apply to
 disclosures and discovery requests, responses, objections, and
 motions under Rules 26 through 37.

PER CURIAM:

The questions presented are whether the district court properly
dismissed plaintiff’s complaint and whether the court properly awarded
sanctions pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
We hold that the dismissal was proper, but that Rule 11 does not provide
authority for the sanctions imposed in this case.

I

Appellant is a black employee at the Chesapeake Health Department in
Chesapeake, Virginia. After receiving "Right to Sue” letters from the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, she filed this employment
discrimination suit on February 16, 1989. The individual appellees, the
present and former directors of the Department, filed a motion to
dismiss on March 13, 1989. The City of Chesapeake filed a motion for
summary judgment on March 20, 1989.

An initial pretrial conference was held on April 3, 1989, at which all
counsel were present. At the conference, an April 17, 1989 deadline was
established for appellant to file responses to the motions to dismiss
and for summary judgment, and a hearing on these motions was scheduled
for May 2, 1989. Appellant failed to oppose these motions, and appellees
moved for judgment on the pleadings. After appellant's counsel also
failed to appear at the May 2, 1989 hearing, the district court granted
appellees' motions and dismissed the complaint.

The court concluded that the Department and its employees were agents of
the state, not the City. Therefore, the court granted the City’s motion
for summary judgment and held that the Eleventh Amendment barred
appellant's claims for damages and other relief. The Court also held
that all of appellant's claims should be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6)
for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.
Appellant’s "vague and conclusory” allegations were insufficient to
satisfy the notice pleading requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure. In the alternative, the court held that "plaintiff’s
continued failure to follow the rules and orders of this Court or even
to appear in Court as required justifies dismissal under Rule 41(b).”

Appellees moved for an award of attorneys’ fees and costs, and appellant
moved under Rule 60(b) for relief from the order of dismissal. The
district court denied the Rule 60(b) motion, finding no excuse for
appellant’s counsel’s neglect in failing to respond to appellees’
motions to dismiss and for summary judgment. The court extended the
deadline for appellant to oppose appellees’ motion for attorneys’ fees
and costs, but appellant again failed to file any opposition. Thus, on
July 13, 1989, the district court granted appellees’ motion for
attorneys’ fees and costs.

II

The allegations in appellant’s complaint are insufficient to state a
claim upon which relief can be granted. Appellant alleges that she was
"required to work in places and under conditions where prejudice and
bias exist,” but her complaint nowhere alleges any specific oppressive
conditions or expressions of "prejudice and bias.” She alleges that she
was "denied opportunities to be promoted,” but never indicates the
positions for which she applied. She asserts that she was "treated
poorly on the job and harassed,” but described no specific incidents of
improper treatment or of harassment. As the district court stated:

> The Complaint contains no factual allegations whatsoever to support
> these charges. The plaintiff has set forth no specific incidents of
> discrimination, no details of promotions to which she was entitled but
> which she did not receive, no explanation of the forms that any
> alleged harassment took, no specifics regarding her claims of
> disparate treatment of blacks and whites. The Complaint alleges
> religious discrimination but fails even to state what plaintiff’s
> religious affiliation is, let alone how it has been the basis of any
> discriminatory acts. In short, the Complaint fails to allege
> sufficient facts to state a claim of racial or religious
> discrimination.

Appellant’s conclusory allegations of discrimination and harassment do
not state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The district court
properly dismissed appellant's complaint in its entirety.

In the alternative, the district court did not abuse its discretion when
it dismissed appellant’s complaint for failure to comply with court
orders. Appellant failed to oppose appellees’ motions to dismiss and for
summary judgment, even after the district court extended the time to
respond, and appellant’s counsel failed to appear at the May 2, 1989
hearing. The district court acted within its discretion when it
dismissed the complaint under Rule 41(b).

III

Although appellees moved for attorneys’ fees and costs under Rules 11
and 54(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and under 42 U.S.C. §
1988, the district court’s order awarding fees and costs mentions only
Rule 11. Rule 11 states:

> Every pleading, motion, and other paper of a party represented by an
> attorney shall be signed by at least one attorney of record in the
> attorney's individual name. The signature of an attorney or party
> constitutes a certificate by the signer that the signer has read the
> pleading, motion, or other paper; that to the best of the signer's
> knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, it
> is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good
> faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of
> existing law, and that it is not interposed for any improper purpose,
> such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase
> in the cost of litigation. If a pleading, motion, or other paper is
> signed in violation of this rule, the court, upon motion or upon its
> own initiative, shall impose upon the person who signed it, a
> represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction, which may include
> an order to pay to the other party or parties the amount of the
> reasonable expenses incurred because of the filing of the pleading,
> motion, or other paper, including a reasonable attorney's fee.

The rule imposes "a duty to conduct a pre-filing examination of both the
facts and the law before instituting legal process.” The rule does not
purport to be a means for district courts to sanction conduct in the
course of a lawsuit, such as failure to comply with court orders, that
does not involve the signing of pleadings, motions, or other papers.

The district court faulted appellant for filing a suit in which the
"weight of existing law” favored appellees, but the court admitted that
there was a legal basis for appellant’s Title VII claims. The court
justified its sanction under Rule 11 by noting that appellant had failed
to oppose the motions to dismiss and for summary judgment and that the
complaint set forth only vague and conclusory allegations. But this does
not establish that there was not a factual and legal basis for
appellant’s claim under Title VII. It merely establishes that
appellant’s counsel failed to comply with court orders and filed an
inartfully pled complaint. Even a vague and conclusory complaint may be
"well grounded in fact and warranted by existing law or a good faith
argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.”
Indeed, if Rule 11 permitted sanctions merely on the basis of inartful
pleading, rather than for a failure to investigate the legal and factual
basis for that pleading, Rule 12(e) motions for a more definite
statement would be virtually unheard of. The fact that appellant's
complaint was vague and conclusory does not justify sanctions under Rule
11.

The district court also awarded attorneys’ fees and costs because of
appellant’s counsel’s "blatant disregard” for the local rules of the
district court and for "his lackadaisical attitude in failing to respond
to defendants’ Motion for Award of Attorneys’ Fees.” Because the order
awarding fees and costs does not indicate any other source of authority,
we must presume that the district court awarded fees on this ground
pursuant to Rule 11. Again, Rule 11 is inapplicable. Rule 16(f)
specifically provides for sanctions "if a party or party’s attorney
fails to obey a scheduling or pretrial order, or if no appearance is
made on behalf of a party at a scheduling or pretrial conference.” In
contrast, Rule 11, by its own terms, can never be the basis for
sanctions for failure to file certain papers. Thus, although appellant’s
counsel’s conduct in the course of this lawsuit fully justified
sanctions, Rule 11 is an inappropriate vehicle for the imposition of
such sanctions. Because appellees’ motion for attorneys’ fees and costs
rested on a number of grounds and because the district court appeared to
rely only on Rule 11, the award of fees and costs must be vacated and
the issue remanded to the district court for consideration of
alternative bases for such an award.

IV

The district court properly dismissed appellant's complaint for failure
to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and for failure to
comply with court orders. Although the district court had ample grounds
under Rule 16(f) for imposing sanctions on appellant's counsel, Rule 11
does not provide authority for sanctions in this case.

_Questions:_

1. Should the circuit court have read Rule 11 this narrowly?

2. If sanctions were permitted on a basis other than Rule 11, why
 didn’t the circuit court affirm on alternative grounds?

3. Should plaintiff’s failure to respond be sanctionable? What about
 defendant’s failure to respond?

WILKINS, Circuit Judge:

Pamela A. Sargent, an Assistant Attorney General for the Commonwealth of
Virginia, appeals a sanction imposed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 11 enjoining application of the Prison Litigation Reform Act
to inmate Richard Cox in any civil action in the United States District
Court for the Western District of Virginia. We reverse.

I.

Cox, a Virginia prisoner, filed an action against Warden Lonnie Saunders
and other prison officials, alleging that they had violated his
constitutional rights by, _inter alia_, intentionally subjecting him to
harmful prison conditions. The prison officials filed a motion to
dismiss Cox’s action, which was granted except as to one claim. Soon
afterward, the district court issued a notice informing Cox of the
passage and practical effects of the PLRA. The court correctly explained
that under the PLRA

> A prisoner may not bring a civil action without prepayment of the
> appropriate filing fee if the prisoner has, on three or more prior
> occasions, brought an action or appeal in a federal court that was
> dismissed as frivolous, as malicious, or for failure to state a claim
> upon which relief may be granted, unless the prisoner is under
> imminent danger of serious physical injury.

Shortly thereafter, Sargent filed a motion for summary judgment on
behalf of the prison officials. In the penultimate paragraph of the
accompanying memorandum, she asserted:

> Cox has already had two cases dismissed for being frivolous or for
> failure to state a claim. Pursuant to the newly enacted Prison
> Litigation Reform Act, Cox will forfeit the right to file future cases
> if a third case is found to be frivolous, malicious or fails to state
> a claim upon which relief can be granted. The prison officials submit
> that this is that third case and that an Order should be entered
> dismissing the case with prejudice, awarding them costs and attorney's
> fees, and barring Cox from future filings.

Approximately one week later, Cox requested that his action be dismissed
without prejudice, and the district court granted the dismissal.
Thereafter, however, the district court granted Cox’s motion to
reinstate the action. In ruling on that motion, the district court found
that Sargent’s contentions were "a blatant misrepresentation of the
content of that provision and its application to this case” because a
portion of Cox’s complaint had already survived a motion to dismiss. The
district court also noted that Sargent had misstated the law regarding
the filing of future cases because § 1915(g) of the PLRA provides that
an inmate who has three qualifying dismissed cases is not barred from
all future filings but only from filing actions _in forma pauperis_ when
he does not face an imminent danger of serious physical injury. The
district court directed Sargent to show cause why the memorandum in
support of the motion for summary judgment did not violate Federal Rule
of Civil Procedure 11(b). After receiving Sargent’s response, the
district court determined that sanctions were warranted and enjoined
application of § 1915(g) to Cox until further order of the court.

II\.

Sargent first argues that the sanction should be reversed because the
district court abused its discretion in finding that the legal
contentions contained in the memorandum in support of the motion for
summary judgment violated Rule 11. We agree.

The provisions of Rule 11 dictate that in presenting a motion to a
court, an attorney represents that the "legal contentions therein are
warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the
extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the
establishment of new law.” An assertion of law violates Rule 11(b)(2)
when, applying a standard of objective reasonableness, it can be said
that "a reasonable attorney in like circumstances could not have
believed his actions to be legally justified.” A legal contention is
unjustified when "a reasonable attorney would recognize it as
frivolous.” Put differently, a legal position violates Rule 11 if it
"has absolutely no chance of success under the existing precedent.”

Here, the district court first took issue with Sargent's contention that
the earlier dismissal of some of the claims in Cox’s present lawsuit
should be considered his third strike for the purpose of § 1915(g).
However, ten of the eleven claims in Cox's complaint had been dismissed
for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, and it
was well within the bounds of fair adversarial argument for the
Government to suggest that the remaining claim must also be dismissed as
frivolous, causing the three-strike rule to apply. If the latter
occurred, Cox’s underlying suit could indeed constitute the third strike
against him. We cannot say that the position had no chance of success
under existing law.

The district court next found fault with Sargent’s representation that
pursuant to § 1915(g) a third dismissal for frivolity, malice, or
failure to state a claim would bar Cox from future filings. Assuredly,
Sargent’s legal contention was not a complete explanation of the
consequences of a third strike. But, the consequences of a third strike
in all future cases were not put into issue by the motion. And, Sargent
explains that the statement was meant to convey only that Cox would be
barred from filing cases pursuant to § 1915 — the statute at issue —
which addresses only _in forma pauperis_ filings. Thus, although
Sargent’s statement of the consequences of obtaining a third strike
perhaps was not completely thorough, it can plausibly be read as a mere
shorthand reference to the statute and was not unwarranted under the
circumstances. Accordingly, we find the decision of the district court
to sanction Sargent under Rule 11 constituted an abuse of discretion.

III\.

Sargent also maintains that even if her conduct warranted sanctions, the
district court abused its discretion in choosing the particular sanction
imposed. "A sanction imposed for violation of Rule 11 shall be limited
to what is sufficient to deter repetition” of the objectionable conduct.
This court has made "clear that the primary purpose of Rule 11 is to
deter future litigation abuse.” Other objectives advanced by the
imposition of a sanction are remediation of the harm caused by the Rule
11 violation, for example by compensating the victim for attorney’s fees
expended in responding to the frivolous claim; punishment of the person
or entity responsible for the violation; and enhancement of judicial
administration.

With these purposes in mind, we conclude that the district court abused
its discretion in ruling that the sanction imposed was limited to what
was sufficient to deter Sargent’s conduct. The finding by the district
court that Sargent violated Rule 11 by advancing an unsupported legal
assertion essentially amounts to a public reprimand that, in and of
itself, should be a significant deterrent to future violations. And,
there is no serious suggestion that further sanction was necessary to
curb future abuses by Sargent. Further, Cox was in no way prejudiced by
Sargent’s legal assertion. Assuming that Cox moved to dismiss his action
based upon Sargent’s legal representations, the district court permitted
reinstatement of the action upon Cox’s request. Thus, the imposition of
any sanction was unnecessary for purposes of remediating harm caused by
the Rule 11 violation. Moreover, assuming that Cox was prejudiced in
some way by Sargent’s statements, the sanction imposed by the district
court failed to provide remediation because it had no potential to
alleviate any type of harm that Cox could have suffered in the present
litigation. Indeed, we can envision no circumstances in which such a
sanction would be appropriate to remediate harm to a victim of a Rule 11
violation. Finally, there is no suggestion that an injunction on
application of § 1915(g) to Cox was necessary to punish Sargent or to
enhance judicial administration. For that matter, it is difficult to say
that the sanction adversely impacted Sargent in the least. And, we fail
to appreciate how the suspension of a statute specifically designed to
reduce the amount of frivolous prisoner litigation could be thought to
enhance the administration of justice. Accordingly, we conclude that the
district court abused its discretion in choosing a sanction to impose
upon Sargent even if her conduct had violated Rule 11.

_Questions:_

1. When should an argument in a pleading be sanctionable under Rule 11?

2. Should prosecutors and other government lawyers be held to a
 different standard than private attorneys or pro se litigants?

3. What is the appropriate sanction for a Rule 11 violation?

WILKINSON, Circuit Judge:

Cleveland Demolition seeks to set aside an earlier jury verdict for
Azcon Scrap on the basis that Azcon’s trial attorney conspired with a
witness to present perjured testimony. The only evidence of this alleged
conspiracy, however, is an evidentiary conflict between the witness’s
testimony and statements made by a different party in a subsequent
lawsuit. This routine evidentiary conflict does not justify an action
for fraud on the court or the serious allegations of attorney misconduct
leveled in this case. We therefore affirm the district court’s decision
to grant summary judgment for Azcon and to impose Rule 11 sanctions on
Cleveland and its attorneys.

I.

In 1983, Cleveland Demolition demolished a power plant for an electric
company in West Virginia, leaving Cleveland with several tons of scrap
material. In June 1983, Paul Haddad, who represented himself as the
president of Cleveland, contacted Richard Spine, a vice-president of
Azcon Scrap, to inquire whether Azcon was interested in buying the
scrap. After inspecting the site and negotiating over terms, Spine and
Haddad signed a contract on July 14th. When an Azcon crew arrived at the
demolition site, however, it was prevented from removing the scrap by
Cleveland employees, who informed them that Haddad was not the president
of Cleveland and had no authority to sign the contract with Azcon. Azcon
sued Cleveland for breach of contract.

A crucial issue at trial was whether Haddad had apparent authority to
sell the scrap for Cleveland Demolition. Azcon presented a great deal of
evidence to justify its belief that Haddad was the president of
Cleveland. For example, Cleveland employees at the scrap site had
treated Haddad as if he were the president and a representative of the
electric company had told Spine that Haddad was the president of
Cleveland. Haddad also testified that Phillip Schwab, the owner of
Cleveland, had asked him to act as president in dealing with the West
Virginia electric company because a different Schwab company had
defaulted on an earlier contract with the same power company.

During the trial, Spine testified that on July 5th, before signing the
contract with Haddad, he requested a verbal Dun & Bradstreet report on
Cleveland Demolition from Azcon’s Chicago office. According to Spine,
Azcon’s Chicago office reported that Haddad was listed as the president
of Cleveland Demolition. After learning that Haddad was not the actual
president, Azcon requested a print-out of the Dun & Bradstreet report.
This report, dated August 2nd and introduced at trial, indicated that
Haddad was the president of Cleveland. Based on this evidence, the jury
returned a $500,000 verdict for Azcon. This court affirmed in an
unpublished opinion, concluding that "sufficient evidence exists to
support the jury’s finding that Paul Haddad was acting as an agent of
Cleveland Demolition.”

Cleveland now claims that the earlier verdict should be vacated because
Spine deliberately lied when he testified that he requested a Dun &
Bradstreet report on July 5th. To support this charge of perjury,
Cleveland claims that Spine’s pretrial deposition, in contrast to his
specific trial testimony, was ambiguous and did not clearly reveal that
he requested a July report. Moreover, Cleveland notes that Dun &
Bradstreet has no internal record of a request by Azcon for information
on July 5th. Cleveland concludes that Spine lied about the July request
to help Azcon's case.

Cleveland does not stop at alleging perjury by Spine. It claims that
Azcon’s trial attorney, Lawrence Demase, conspired with Spine to present
this perjured testimony. In an attempt to prove Demase’s involvement,
Cleveland notes that he prepared two affidavits for Spine, but neither
affidavit mentioned a July 5th request for a Dun & Bradstreet report.
Nonetheless, Demase questioned Spine about the July 5th report at the
trial and used this testimony in his opening and closing statements.
Cleveland cites as further evidence of Demase’s participation his
acknowledgement that he and Spine reviewed Spine’s deposition statements
and concluded that they did not completely reflect what Spine had
intended to say. Finally, Cleveland claims that Demase should have known
that Spine did not request a report on July 5th because Dun & Bradstreet
has no record of this request.

In sum, Cleveland believes that Spine must have perjured himself because
his deposition is unclear and his trial testimony conflicts with Dun &
Bradstreet’s records. Cleveland concludes that Demase must have actively
participated in this perjury because he was Azcon’s trial attorney.
Relying on such conclusory allegations, Cleveland brought this
independent action to set aside the earlier verdict, claiming that it
was obtained by a fraud on the court. The district court granted Azcon’s
motion for summary judgment, finding that there was "no evidence here
that either Spine gave false testimony or that Demase participated.” The
district court noted that Cleveland had produced no "smoking gun”, nor
even so much as a "singed paperclip.” Because Cleveland’s attorneys did
not adequately investigate the factual or legal basis for this lawsuit,
the district court also assessed attorney fees and costs under Rule 11.

II\.

A verdict may be set aside for fraud on the court if an attorney and a
witness have conspired to present perjured testimony. The only evidence
that Spine committed perjury, however, is the conflict between his trial
testimony and Dun & Bradstreet’s version of the July 5th report; the
only evidence of Demase’s involvement is that he was Azcon’s trial
attorney. This meager evidence falls woefully short of proving a fraud
on the court. More importantly, if a losing party could attack a verdict
whenever two witnesses disagreed and an attorney was involved, no
verdict would be final. The district court properly granted summary
judgment for Azcon.

District courts may entertain an independent action in equity to set
aside a judgment for fraud on the court. Fraud on the court is a serious
allegation, however, involving "corruption of the judicial process
itself.” A verdict will be vacated only in the "most egregious cases in
which the integrity of the court and its ability to function impartially
is directly impinged.” Although perjury by a witness will not suffice,
the "involvement of an attorney, as an officer of the court, in a scheme
to suborn perjury should certainly be considered fraud on the court.”
Thus, if Spine deliberately lied and Demase participated in the fraud,
the earlier verdict for Azcon should be set aside.

According to Cleveland, Spine must have committed perjury because his
deposition is vague and Dun & Bradstreet has no record of a July 5th
request. Cleveland, however, overestimates the ambiguity of the
deposition. Although not a model of clarity, Spine’s deposition does
state that he requested a verbal Dun & Bradstreet report when the Azcon
employees inspected the demolition site, which was in late June or early
July. The deposition also shows that Spine claimed that Azcon’s Chicago
office reported that Haddad was listed as the president on the Dun &
Bradstreet report. The deposition is not inconsistent with Spine’s
subsequent testimony; the trial testimony is simply more specific.

The lack of a Dun & Bradstreet record also fails to show that Spine
committed perjury. Cleveland did not learn that there was no record
until it sued Dun & Bradstreet for negligently informing Azcon that
Haddad was the president. Thus, the statements by Dun & Bradstreet
employees that they have no internal record actually amount to nothing
more than unverified, exculpatory claims by an interested party. This
evidence does not show that Spine never requested a report from the
Chicago office or that Spine deliberately lied on the stand. It simply
shows that Spine and Dun & Bradstreet disagree over whether Azcon made a
request on July 5th. Although Cleveland could certainly have used this
evidence to impeach Spine during the initial trial, it cannot use this
routine evidentiary conflict to support an action for fraud on the
court.

Cleveland has produced even less evidence of Demase’s involvement in
this alleged conspiracy. Demase acted only as Azcon’s trial attorney,
performing such typical activities as preparing affidavits and
questioning witnesses. Cleveland apparently argues for a virtually
automatic rule that, whenever a witness lies on the stand, his attorney
must have known about and actively participated in the perjury. In
addition to being unjustified, this rule would allow parties to
circumvent the Rule 60(b)(3) one-year time limitation on motions to set
aside a judgment for fraud or misrepresentation. Losing parties could
transform a perjury case into an action for fraud on the court simply by
alleging that an attorney was present.

In essence, Cleveland asks this court to vacate the earlier verdict
because Spine’s testimony conflicts with the Dun & Bradstreet statements
and Demase participated in the trial. Not only does this argument fail
to establish any evidence of a fraud on the court, but it seriously
undermines the principle of finality. If a routine evidentiary dispute,
which occurs in virtually all trials, could justify an action for fraud
on the court, then any losing party could bring an independent action to
set aside the verdict, forcing extended proceedings in almost every
case. Because Rule 60(b) imposes no time limit on these independent
actions, they could be brought at any time. Thus, under Cleveland’s
version of the doctrine, no verdict would ever be final until a second
proceeding was held to determine if there was a fraud on the court.

Rather than unravel the finality of judgments through the abuse of Rule
60(b), we adhere to the well-established rule that evidentiary conflicts
must be resolved during the initial trial. Cleveland should have been
aware of the conflict between Spine’s testimony and Dun & Bradstreet’s
records; Spine’s deposition was specific enough to put Cleveland on
notice. Having failed to depose Dun & Bradstreet in time for the trial,
Cleveland cannot avoid the verdict by leveling a charge of fraud on the
court. Because Cleveland has produced no evidence of a conspiracy
between Spine and Demase, Azcon was entitled to summary judgment.

III\.

After granting summary judgment, the district court imposed Rule 11
sanctions on Cleveland and its attorneys for filing this action. A
decision to impose sanctions will be reversed only for an abuse of
discretion. Because Cleveland did not conduct a reasonable investigation
of the factual and legal basis for this claim, we think the district
court acted well within its discretion in imposing sanctions.

When an attorney signs a complaint, he certifies that "to the best of
his knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry,
the complaint is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing
law.” Under this rule, Cleveland’s attorneys were required to
investigate the factual and legal basis for the claim before filing this
lawsuit. The 1972 amendments underscored this duty by eliminating the
subjective "good faith” harbor and requiring an attorney to conduct an
objectively reasonable investigation. If an attorney signs a complaint
without undertaking the necessary investigation, Rule 11 provides that
the district court "shall” impose sanctions.

The district court found that Cleveland did not conduct a reasonable
factual or legal investigation. We agree. Although Cleveland discovered
a conflict between the Spine and Dun & Bradstreet versions, this
discovery should have been only the beginning of the inquiry into
whether Spine committed perjury. Rather than continuing its
investigation, however, Cleveland was apparently satisfied with a few
interviews with a Dun & Bradstreet employee.

A complaint of this nature has a potentially devastating impact upon
professional reputations. Even if Cleveland had found evidence of
perjury, it had an obligation to investigate whether attorney Demase was
involved. Cleveland’s inquiry never produced any evidence that Demase
participated in Spine’s alleged perjury. As the district court noted,
"this part of Cleveland’s case has always been nothing more than
speculative and conclusory.” Instead of conducting a reasonable factual
investigation, Cleveland apparently chose to build its case on the
unsupported assumption that Spine must have been lying and that Demase
must have been participating. This speculative basis for a Rule 60(b)
action alleging attorney misconduct of the most serious nature does not
satisfy Rule 11 standards.

Cleveland also failed to conduct a reasonable legal investigation to
determine if the complaint was "warranted by existing law.” Cleveland
limited its inquiry to a brief reading of Rule 60, a portion of American
Jurisprudence, a Federal Procedure Guide, and _Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v.
Hartford-Empire Co._ (1944). If Cleveland had conducted even a minimal
investigation into Fourth Circuit precedent, it would have discovered
_Great Coastal Express v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters_.
Although _Great Coastal_ suggests that a conspiracy by a witness and an
attorney to commit perjury will amount to a fraud on the court, the case
specifically notes that other sanctions exist to punish perjury and that
"perjury or fabricated evidence are not grounds for relief as a fraud on
the court.” Thus, even if Cleveland had evidence of perjury by Spine, it
was still required to show that Demase participated. Because Cleveland
had absolutely no evidence of involvement by Demase, a quick reading of
_Great Coastal_ would have revealed that Cleveland’s complaint had
"absolutely no chance of success under the existing precedent.”

In sum, Rule 11 "explicitly and unambiguously imposes an affirmative
duty on each attorney to conduct a reasonable inquiry into the validity
of a pleading before it is signed.” The Rule does not seek to stifle the
exuberant spirit of skilled advocacy or to require that a claim be
proven before a complaint can be filed. The Rule attempts to discourage
the needless filing of groundless lawsuits. To fulfill his duty, an
attorney must investigate the facts, examine the law, and then decide
whether the complaint is justified. Cleveland failed to discharge this
duty; it conducted only a minimal factual inquiry and a cursory legal
investigation. The district court properly imposed sanctions.

In determining the specific amount of the sanctions, the district court
reduced Azcon’s legal fees by 10%, finding that the case was slightly
over-lawyered and did not require a trial. The hourly fees of several
attorneys were lowered to reflect the prevailing local rate, while the
fees of attorneys from out of state were reduced by 10% because they
failed to provide the district court with sufficient information about
their professional backgrounds. These adjustments are consistent with
the twelve factors listed in _Barber v. Kimbrell's, Inc._, and we
therefore affirm the amount of the award in this case.

_Questions:_

1. What was the basis for Cleveland’s claim that Spine perjured
 himself?

2. What investigation should Cleveland have done before filing its
 motion to vacate?

3. Is it possible that Spine did not request a verbal report from Dun &
 Bradstreet? Does it matter?

CHAPMAN, Circuit Judge:

Three attorneys appeal the award of Rule 11 sanctions against them in
the amount of $122,834.28. Appellants were sanctioned following the
dismissal of a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action, in which they represented
certain plaintiffs seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief from
the Governor of North Carolina, a number of North Carolina district
attorneys, a sheriff, certain State Bureau of Investigation officers,
the State Attorney General and others for an allegedly improper state
criminal prosecution and harassment. We affirm in part, vacate in part,
and remand with instructions.

I

The appellant attorneys are Barry Nakell, a professor at the University
of North Carolina School of Law; Lewis Pitts, Director of the Christic
Institute South, a public interest law firm in Carrboro, North Carolina;
and William Kunstler, a nationally known civil rights attorney. The §
1983 action was connected with the appellants’ earlier representation of
two American Indians, Eddie Hatcher and Timothy Jacobs, in a federal
criminal case.

On February 1, 1988, Hatcher and Jacobs staged an armed takeover of The
Robesonian, a local newspaper in Robeson County, North Carolina. Hatcher
and Jacobs held twenty hostages and charged the State District Attorney
and the Sheriff’s Office with corruption and criminal misconduct.
Hatcher and Jacobs surrendered to federal authorities in exchange for a
promise that a Governor’s Task Force would investigate their complaints.
The Task Force ultimately announced that it had found no evidence to
support Hatcher’s and Jacobs’ charges.

Hatcher and Jacobs were acquitted of federal criminal charges on October
14, 1988, but North Carolina District Attorney Joe Freeman Britt
announced that Hatcher and Jacobs might face state indictments. Soon
after that announcement, Hatcher began a petition drive seeking to have
Hubert and Kevin Stone removed from the Sheriff’s Office. The Robeson
Defense Committee, which had supported Hatcher in his federal trial,
supported the petition drive. In November 1988, newspaper reports
indicated that the State Bureau of Investigation was investigating
whether there had been a conspiracy in the takeover of The Robesonian.

Appellants Barry Nakell and Lewis Pitts contacted the Attorney General’s
office to express their concern that SBI agents would intimidate
citizens who were working with Hatcher in the petition drive. The
Attorney General responded that no action would be taken by his office
because he did not believe that the SBI was engaged in any abuse of
process. Attorney Nakell alleges that the Deputy Attorney General orally
admitted that the decision was political.

Attorney Pitts volunteered legal assistance to anyone on the Robeson
Defense Committee subjected to harassment because of their participation
in the petition drive. Appellants allege that six members of the Defense
Committee contacted Attorneys Pitts and Nakell with claims of harassment
by SBI agents and the Sheriff's Department, primarily involving
surveillance and questioning.

On December 6, 1988, Hatcher and Jacobs were indicted on state charges.
After the indictment, Jacobs fought extradition from New York. Hatcher
was in federal custody in California.

By late December 1988, appellants contend that they believed that
Jacobs’ extradition, the pending state prosecutions, and an alleged
pattern of activity by the District Attorney and his staff, members of
the Sheriff's Department, and the SBI raised constitutional concerns
which could only be resolved by a civil suit, because public officials
were unresponsive. Appellants contend that they also believed that there
was an illegal campaign to split Jacobs from Hatcher, and to interfere
with Jacobs' right to counsel by persuading him to hire local counsel.

Attorneys Pitts and Nakell contend that they initially refrained from
filing the complaint in hopes of enhancing Jacobs’ plea bargaining
opportunities, but Mr. Nakell filed the complaint on January 31, 1989,
the eve of the one-year anniversary of the armed takeover of The
Robesonian, and he called a press conference to announce the filing. An
amended complaint, signed by all three appellants, was filed on March
16, 1989.

The suit named eight plaintiffs, including various members of the
Robeson Defense Committee, and Jacobs and Hatcher. The thirty-page
amended complaint names nineteen defendants, including two district
attorneys and members of their staffs, five SBI agents, the SBI
Director, the Sheriff of Robeson County and five Deputy Sheriffs, the
Attorney General of North Carolina, and the Governor of North Carolina.
The complaint alleges First Amendment and Sixth Amendment violations
concerning an alleged campaign of intimidation of political activity,
and efforts to induce Jacobs to testify against Hatcher. All defendants
were sued in their official and individual capacities, except the
Governor, who was named only in his official capacity in a count seeking
an injunction against extradition. The complaint also sought injunctions
against the pending state criminal prosecutions, and against the
defendants’ harassment and interference with the attorney-client
relationship established by Jacobs. The complaint sought damages against
all individually named defendants and Robeson County.

After the case was filed, appellants sought expedited discovery to
depose defendant SBI agent Bowman, who was the case agent in the state’s
pending criminal action against Jacobs and Hatcher. The defendants moved
for a protective order claiming that discovery was improperly sought to
obtain information concerning the state criminal proceedings, which
plaintiffs could not otherwise obtain. The district court did not rule
on this motion prior to the dismissal of the case. In late March 1989,
Jacobs, having failed in resisting extradition, was returned to North
Carolina. In April, Jacobs agreed to a plea bargain. Appellants contend
that a variety of events then caused them to reevaluate the viability of
their civil suit, and to conclude that dismissal was appropriate.

On April 20, Mr. Nakell called Joan Byers, a Special Deputy Attorney
General, seeking defendants’ approval to a stipulated dismissal under
Rule 41(a)(1)(ii). Byers would not stipulate to a dismissal under Rule
41(a)(1), but authorized appellants to state that defendants did not
object to a dismissal under Rule 41(a)(2). Appellants proceeded under
Rule 41(a)(2), and the order dismissing the case was entered on May 2,
1989.

On June 13, 1989, the state defendants filed their Rule 11 motion, and
the county defendants filed a similar motion for sanctions on July 5. On
August 8, appellants responded to the Rule 11 motions and requested an
evidentiary hearing. On September 5, appellants filed a Rule 11 motion
seeking sanctions against the appellees. On September 8, the court heard
arguments of counsel and shortly thereafter requested submissions by
defendants’ counsel of their fees and expenses. On September 29, the
district court imposed Rule 11 sanctions upon appellants, and dismissed
appellants' Rule 11 motion. Sanctions against appellants included full
fees and costs of $92,834.28 and $10,000 additional sanctions against
each appellant based upon the baseless claims which appellants had taken
care to publicize. We affirm the district court's findings that
appellants violated all three prongs of Rule 11, but vacate and remand
for reconsideration of the appropriate sanction.

II

SANCTIONS AFTER DISMISSAL

Initially, we must determine whether the defendants' failure to notify
the plaintiffs or the court prior to dismissal that defendants intended
to file a Rule 11 motion should have precluded consideration of the Rule
11 motion. Appellants cite _Barr Labs., Inc. v. Abbott Labs._, where the
Second Circuit affirmed the denial of a Rule 11 motion filed after a
stipulated dismissal under Rule 41(a)(1)(ii). There, the defendant’s
attorney did not indicate an intention to seek Rule 11 sanctions prior
to dismissal and implied in a letter to plaintiff's counsel, prior to
the dismissal, that sanctions would not be sought if the case were
voluntarily dismissed. The _Barr_ court enunciated a rule "prohibiting a
motion for Rule 11 sanctions after the execution of a stipulation of
dismissal without a reservation of the right to move for such relief.”

The present case is different from _Barr_ because it does not involve a
stipulated dismissal, which requires opposing counsel to sign the
dismissal order. We have a dismissal under Rule 41(a)(2), which does not
require a stipulation by the defendants. No court has adopted a rule
prohibiting a motion for Rule 11 sanctions after a dismissal with
prejudice under Rule 41(a)(2). In addition, unlike _Barr_, there is no
evidence that defendants indicated that they would not pursue Rule 11
sanctions. We decline to extend _Barr_ to dismissals under Rule
41(a)(2).

Appellants also argue that since Rule 41(a)(2) specifies that dismissal
is subject to such "terms and conditions as the court deems proper,” the
potential for Rule 11 sanctions should be stated by a defendant as a
condition to a dismissal. We disagree. Rule 41(a)(2) does not require
the defendant or a court to indicate the possibility of Rule 11
sanctions as a "term or condition” of a plaintiff’s dismissal. Recently,
in _Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp._, the Supreme Court hypothesized
that even a Rule 11 sanction which prohibited refiling a complaint
dismissed without prejudice under Rule 41(a)(1) would not be a "term or
condition” placed upon the dismissal. Waiver of a Rule 11 motion may not
be a condition to dismissal because a decision not to dismiss may not
prevent the imposition of sanctions for an improvidently filed
complaint. "As the ‘violation of Rule 11 is complete when the paper is
filed,’ a voluntary dismissal does not expunge the Rule 11 violation.”

There may be circumstances under which Rule 11 sanctions should not be
granted after the voluntary dismissal of a case, _i.e._, a defendant has
indicated an intent not to pursue sanctions, or the motion is filed an
inordinately long time after the dismissal. "Although Rule 11 does not
establish a deadline for the imposition of sanctions, the Advisory
Committee did not contemplate there would be a lengthy delay prior to
their imposition.” However, these considerations are equitable, and must
be resolved on a case by case analysis. The party seeking sanctions may
avoid such problems by notifying his opponent and the court of his
intention to pursue sanctions at the earliest possible date.

As the Supreme Court has recently confirmed, there is no jurisdictional
bar to the imposition of sanctions after a voluntary dismissal.

> In order to comply with Rule 11's requirement that a court "shall”
> impose sanctions "if a pleading, motion, or other paper is signed in
> violation of this rule,” a court must have the authority to consider
> whether there has been a violation of the signing requirement
> regardless of the dismissal of the underlying action.

"The only time limitation in filing Rule 11 arises out of equitable
considerations.” The defendants filed their motion six weeks after the
Rule 41(a)(2) dismissal, the appellants were not prejudiced by
appellees’ delay in filing, and the district court’s consideration of
the motion was proper.

III VIOLATIONS OF RULE 11

Rule 11 states, in relevant part:

> The signature of an attorney or party constitutes a certificate by the
> signer that the signer has read the pleading, motion, or other paper;
> that to the best of the signer's knowledge, information, and belief
> formed after reasonable inquiry it is well grounded in fact and is
> warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension,
> modification, or reversal of existing law, and that it is not
> interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause
> unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation. If a
> pleading, motion, or other paper is signed in violation of this rule,
> the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, shall impose upon
> the person who signed it, a represented party, or both, an appropriate
> sanction, which may include an order to pay to the other party or
> parties the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred because of the
> filing of the pleading, motion, or other paper, including a reasonable
> attorney’s fee.

The district court found that the three appellants violated all three
prongs of Rule 11 by failing to make a reasonable inquiry to determine
that the complaint stood well grounded in fact and warranted by existing
law, and by filing the complaint for an improper purpose. We review all
aspects of the district court’s Rule 11 determinations under an
abuse-of-discretion standard.

A. Mr. Kunstler’s Liability

Before reviewing the specific violations of Rule 11 found by the
district court, we note that Mr. Kunstler’s affidavit states that he
"did not actively participate in the instant litigation, relying on
Prof. Barry Nakell, who was on the scene, to prepare and file it.” The
district court stated that "in light of the serious allegations in the
complaint, Mr. Kunstler's total reliance on other counsel is itself a
violation of Rule 11.” This finding is supported by a recent
pronouncement of the Supreme Court. Mr. Kunstler’s reliance on others
was indeed an improper delegation of his responsibility under Rule 11 to
certify that the pleading filed over his name was well grounded in fact
and in law.

> The signing attorney cannot leave it to some trusted subordinate, or
> to one of his partners, to satisfy himself that the filed paper is
> factually and legally responsible; by signing he represents not merely
> the fact that it is so, but also the fact that he personally has
> applied his own judgment.

"The purpose of Rule 11 as a whole is to bring home to the individual
signer his personal, nondelegable responsibility.” Having failed in his
responsibility, Mr. Kunstler may not now be heard to protest that he
does not share in any violations of Rule 11 which are evident on the
face of the complaint.

B. Well Grounded in Fact

The district court based sanctions in part on a violation of the first
prong of Rule 11 — finding that the complaint was not well grounded in
fact. An objective test is used "to determine the reasonableness of a
lawyer’s prefiling investigation.” "Blind reliance on the client is
seldom a sufficient inquiry.” Mr. Nakell and Mr. Pitts have argued that
they had "an intimate knowledge of the county and its people; factors
which made them professionally capable of assimilating and weighing the
facts gathered prior to filing the civil suit.” In light of that
knowledge, the factual inaccuracies in the complaint are even more
egregious.

The district court noted numerous misstatements of fact, such as the
assertion that the district attorney "serves as the criminal prosecution
arm of Defendant Robeson County and as such makes policy in police
investigation and criminal prosecution matters for Defendant Robeson
County.” In fact, the District Attorney is an officer of the state, not
an agent nor an employee of the county. Contrary to the complaint,
defendants Britt, Townsend, and Sampson, and the District Attorney’s
staff, are state officers, not agents or employees of Robeson County.
The complaint alleges that District Attorney Britt refused and failed to
discipline, train and supervise the Sheriff’s deputies "under their
control and supervision.” District Attorneys possess no such power or
responsibility.

Appellants acknowledge some errors, but contend they are "isolated” and
thus do not warrant sanctions. We do not agree with this
characterization. The errors pervade the complaint and concern
information which either was or should have been known to appellants.
The errors provide a false foundation for appellants’ allegation of a
county-wide "conspiracy,” and are central to the complaint. Appellants
also suggest that, under _Pembaur v. Cincinnati_ (1986), state officials
can sometimes establish county policy for purposes of § 1983 liability.
Unlike _Pembaur_, there is no provision of North Carolina law which
suggests that the state officials in this case either could or did act
to establish county policy.

Other causes of action were founded on allegations which utterly lacked
any basis in fact. For example, the complaint alleged that the Governor,
the Attorney General and District Attorney entered into a "no state
prosecution” agreement, and this agreement was breached when the state
prosecution commenced. The district court found that prior to filing
their complaint, appellants

> had access to the transcript of the negotiations leading to the
> hostage release agreement as well as a copy of the written agreement.
> Nothing in the agreement or in any of the negotiations, suggests an
> agreement that Hatcher and Jacobs would not face North Carolina
> charges, and none of the negotiators had the authority to so agree.

Moreover, North Carolina law does not grant the Governor or the State
Attorney General the power to bind the state not to prosecute. Neither
the Attorney General nor District Attorney Britt played any role in the
hostage negotiations, but appellants now argue that unspecified
evidence, obtainable through discovery, "could show” that a no
prosecution agreement was made. While a lawyer may rely on discovery to
reveal additional facts to support claims which are well grounded in
fact, Rule 11 sanctions are appropriate when a lawyer attempts to use
discovery to support outrageous and frivolous claims for which there is
no factual support. Unsubstantiated claims such as these constitute an
abuse of the judicial process for which Rule 11 sanctions were designed.

Appellants appear to have relied entirely upon discovery in the hope of
finding some factual support for many of their claims. In their
Memorandum and Opposition to Defendants’ Motion for a Protective Order,
appellants wrote:

> Plaintiffs anticipate that as a result of deposing SBI defendant
> Bowman they will be in a position to apply to the Court for temporary
> injunctive relief and make the showing required by Rule 65(b) of the
> Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Appellants requested a temporary restraining order in their complaint.
Rule 65(b) makes clear that a temporary restraining order may be granted
only if

> it clearly appears from specific facts shown by affidavit or by the
> verified complaint that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or
> damage will result to the applicant before the adverse party or his
> attorney can be heard in opposition.

Rule 65(b) does not authorize counsel to request relief and then search
through discovery for facts to support the relief already requested. The
rule requires that "specific facts” be "shown” to the court with the
request for relief. We agree with the district court that the
appellants’ request for relief and their indication that they were not
"in a position to make the showing required by Rule 65(b)” without later
discovery indicates an unacceptable level of pre-filing investigation.

We affirm the district court's findings that many of the allegations
against state and local officials "have nothing to do with this case and
are factually unsubstantiated.” Allegations which suggest that the
Sheriff is engaged in drug trafficking and that a black inmate died
while in the Sheriff’s custody are irrelevant. These allegations involve
no injury to the plaintiffs, and the report of drug trafficking by the
Sheriff’s Office is wholly unsupported in fact. Appellants protest that
these allegations were represented in the complaint only as beliefs of
their clients, but this does not make them relevant to the complaint or
less scandalous in nature. While irrelevant allegations, standing alone,
may not be cause for Rule 11 sanctions, the existence of numerous
irrelevant, unsubstantiated, and sensational allegations is an
appropriate factor for a district court to consider in determining
whether the pleading as a whole lacks adequate factual foundation.

In this case, the complaint was filled with irrelevant allegations not
tied to specific injuries to plaintiffs, _i.e._, general allegations of
abusive behavior against blacks and Indians, and allegations that
Robeson County is beleaguered by poverty, illiteracy, and violence.
There was little basis for the allegation that Britt, Townsend,
Thornburg and Morgan conspired to appoint Townsend as District Attorney
and to use SBI agents as political police to discredit the Republican
candidate, and that allegation was again irrelevant. Hatcher and Jacobs
had been indicted prior to Townsend’s appointment, and none of the other
candidates for District Attorney suggested that they would not continue
the prosecution. Appellants’ arguments as to the relevance of such
allegations are tangential at best and often strain credulity.

Although Mr. Nakell and Mr. Pitts filed lengthy affidavits detailing
their factual inquiry, such affidavits do not provide factual or legal
support for the inaccuracies noted by the district court. The number of
hours allegedly spent by counsel in prefiling investigation does not
dissuade us from affirming the district court’s findings of Rule 11
violations. Given the adequate time to prepare and hours allegedly spent
in preparation of the complaint, appellants have presented no excuse for
the many clear factual errors in this pleading.

Appellants have argued that, despite the lack of pre-filing foundation
for their claims, it was appropriate to include the claims because
support for them could only be obtained through discovery. In _Kraemer
v. Grant County_, the court held that sanctions were not warranted where
an attorney relied on client information to support a cause of action
based on a theory of conspiracy, even though additional facts were
needed to prove the claim. "If discovery is necessary to establish a
claim, then it is not unreasonable to file a complaint so as to obtain
the right to conduct that discovery.” Despite this sweeping statement,
there were in _Kraemer_ a number of factors cautioning against sanctions
which are not present here. In _Kraemer_, the attorney was a recent law
school graduate, and had hired a private investigator to look into his
client’s allegations. The investigator’s report did not discredit any
part of the client’s story and the prospective defendants refused to
cooperate with the investigator. Only a single portion of the complaint
— that dealing with the proof of state action — was ultimately found to
be without support.

In the present case, appellants are experienced attorneys with both the
time and the means to conduct a responsible factual investigation. The
complaint contains myriad inaccuracies rather than a single error. Many
of the factual inaccuracies could have been discovered by the most
cursory investigation. The irrelevances are inexcusable considering the
attorneys’ experience. Indeed, it is remarkable that so many errors
could have been undetected by appellants. The number of claims without
factual foundation warrants sanctions, whether the errors stem from
incompetency or wilful misconduct.

The need for discovery to complete the factual basis for alleged claims
is not an excuse to allege claims with no factual basis. While we do not
disagree with the result obtained in _Kraemer_, we find that it is not
applicable to the present case. A lawyer is an officer of the court, and
he should never file a lawsuit without confidence that it has a
reasonable basis in fact and is well grounded in law. For the purposes
of Rule 11, the factual inquiry necessary to file a complaint is
generally satisfied if all of the information which can be obtained
prior to suit supports the allegations made, even though further facts
must be obtained through discovery to finally prove the claim. However,
a complaint containing allegations unsupported by any information
obtained prior to filing, or allegations based on information which
minimal factual inquiry would disprove, will subject the author to
sanctions.

C. Well Grounded In Law

The district court found that the complaint was not well grounded in
law. We agree. Appellants contend that the strength of the legal basis
of the complaint is demonstrated by their opponent’s lengthy response to
them, and the approval of a civil rights attorney, who reviewed and
approved of, but did not sign, the complaint. The length of an
opponent’s response to a complaint does not validate the otherwise
insubstantial claims therein, because a lengthy response may reveal less
the merit of particular claims than the number of valid defenses to
them. An opponent may have employed "scorched earth” tactics in
composing a response far beyond what is required to oppose frivolous
claims. Nor is the Rule 11 standard of whether a "reasonable attorney in
like circumstances would believe his actions to be factually and legally
justified” satisfied merely by having another attorney review a
complaint. The reviewing attorney may be unfamiliar with the true facts
of the case, the factual and legal investigation conducted, or the law
relevant to the complaint.

The district court enumerated several substantial claims without legal
foundation. The court found no factual or legal basis for the double
jeopardy claim to the state prosecution of Hatcher and Jacobs following
the federal prosecution, because a subsequent prosecution by a different
sovereign plainly does not constitute double jeopardy. Although a "tool
of the same authorities” exception is possible in some circumstances,
that exception may only be established by proof that State officials had
little or no independent volition in their proceedings. In this case,
however, the complaint alleged that the state officials instituted and
controlled the state proceeding, which precludes the establishment of
that exception. The district court also considered a quotation
attributed to Mr. Pitts in a newspaper article that the state charges
did not constitute double jeopardy. Although we caution the court
against relying too heavily on press reports, we do not fault the
district court for considering the statement.

The district court found without legal foundation the plaintiffs’ claim
that Hatcher’s Fifth Amendment rights were damaged when the state tried
to extract testimony from Jacobs. Fifth Amendment protection is personal
to the individual whose testimony is being compelled and appellants as
experienced attorneys should have been well aware of this. Appellants
make no attempt to explain away this glaring blunder.

Appellants sought to enjoin state criminal proceedings, but the district
court found that the _Younger v. Harris_ abstention doctrine clearly
barred such relief. The court also found that Hatcher and Jacobs could
have presented their federal constitutional claims to the state court.
We agree that plaintiffs had no factual basis for claiming that the
state prosecution was brought in bad faith, or without a reasonable
expectation of conviction, because Hatcher and Jacobs had never denied
taking hostages. Although appellants cite an Eighth Circuit case which
suggests that the _Younger_ abstention doctrine does not apply if "a
prosecution was brought in retaliation for or to discourage the exercise
of constitutional rights ‘regardless of whether valid convictions
conceivably could be obtained,’” that proposition has been rejected by
this court. In _Suggs v. Brannon_, we upheld the use of the _Younger_
abstention doctrine when plaintiffs claimed that their prosecution under
obscenity laws chilled their First Amendment rights.

The district court also noted "serious standing problems with many of
the plaintiffs’ claims.” For example, on the claim that the prosecution
chilled Hatcher and Jacobs’ First Amendment expression, the complaint
presented no facts showing specific harm or threat of harm. Appellants
respond that they did show concrete and specific harm insofar as
plaintiffs’ participation in the petition drive was curtailed. However,
Hatcher and Jacob’s participation was not curtailed, and the district
court’s observation on their standing problem with respect to that claim
is valid.

We therefore affirm the court's findings that the complaint on the whole
was not well grounded in law.

D. Improper Purpose

Sanctions could have been imposed for the violations already discussed,
but the district court also based the award of sanctions on appellants’
improper purpose in filing the complaint. The type and number of Rule 11
violations are considered in determining the appropriate sanction, and
it was proper for the district court to consider appellants’ purpose.
Although the district court first discussed "improper purpose” under
Rule 11, whether or not a pleading has a foundation in fact or is well
grounded in law will often influence the determination of the signer’s
purpose, and we suggest that a district court should consider the first
two prongs of Rule 11 before making a determination of improper purpose.

Appellants argue that the district court’s conclusions as to their
purpose are clearly erroneous, because there is no evidence in the
record to support the court’s findings, or the findings are based on
factual conclusions which were contested by affidavit. The district
court concluded that sanctions would be appropriate based on the
improper purpose of the lawsuit "even if the complaint had a proper
legal and factual basis.” Since we have affirmed the court’s findings
that the complaint in the instant case was not well grounded in law or
in fact, we need not decide whether a complaint which is well grounded
in law and in fact can be sanctioned solely on the basis that it was
filed for an improper purpose. Rather, we look only to whether the court
abused its discretion in finding that the complaint was filed for an
improper purpose.

Rule 11 defines the term "improper purpose” to include factors "such as
to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the
costs of litigation.” The factors mentioned in the rule are not
exclusive. If a complaint is not filed to vindicate rights in court, its
purpose must be improper. However, if a complaint is filed to vindicate
rights in court, and also for some other purpose, a court should not
sanction counsel for an intention that the court does not approve, so
long as the added purpose is not undertaken in bad faith and is not so
excessive as to eliminate a proper purpose. Thus, the purpose to
vindicate rights in court must be central and sincere. Filing of
excessive motions may sometimes constitute "harassment” under the rule
even if the motions are well grounded. Likewise, filing a motion or
pleading without a sincere intent to pursue it will garner sanctions.

We have previously stated that in order to determine "improper purpose,”
a district court must judge the conduct of counsel under an objective
standard of reasonableness rather than assessing subjective intent. This
test was derived from _Zaldivar v. City of Los Angeles_, where it was
stated that "harrassment under Rule 11 focuses upon the improper purpose
of the signer, objectively tested, rather than the consequences of the
signer’s act, subjectively viewed by the signer’s opponent.” In other
words, it is not enough that the injured party subjectively believes
that a lawsuit was brought to harass, or to focus negative publicity on
the injured party; instead, such improper purposes must be derived from
the motive of the signer in pursuing the suit. An opponent in a lawsuit,
particularly a defendant, will nearly always subjectively feel that the
lawsuit was brought for less than proper purposes; plaintiffs and
defendants are not often on congenial terms at the time a suit is
brought. However, a court must ignore evidence of the injured party’s
subjective beliefs and look for more objective evidence of the signer’s
purpose.

There is some paradox involved in this analysis, because it is
appropriate to consider the signer’s subjective beliefs to determine the
signer’s purpose in filing suit, if such beliefs are revealed through an
admission that the signer knew that the motion or pleading was baseless
but filed it nonetheless. This evidence may be said to be "objective” in
the sense that it can be viewed by a court without fear of
misinterpretation; it does not involve difficult determinations of
credibility. Circumstantial facts surrounding the filing may also be
considered as evidence of the signer’s purpose. Repeated filings, the
outrageous nature of the claims made, or a signer’s experience in a
particular area of law, under which baseless claims have been made, are
all appropriate indicators of an improper purpose.

The district court concluded that plaintiffs’ counsel never intended to
litigate this § 1983 action and that counsel filed it for publicity, to
embarrass state and county officials, to use as leverage in criminal
proceedings, to obtain discovery for use in criminal proceedings, and to
intimidate those involved in the prosecution of Hatcher and Jacobs.

The court drew its conclusions without the aid of an evidentiary
hearing, but relied upon the evidence before it. The court’s first
conclusion, that counsel never intended to litigate the action, is the
one which most clearly supports sanctions based on a finding of improper
purpose. The fact that so many allegations in the complaint lacked a
basis in law or in fact strongly supports the court’s finding of
improper purpose. The existence of baseless allegations does not alone
require a finding of improper purpose, because inexperience or
incompetence may have caused their inclusion in a pleading, rather than
or in addition to willfulness or deliberate choice. However, in this
case counsel are clearly not inexperienced, and the number and magnitude
of claims without foundation suggests that incompetence is not the cause
for such allegations in the complaint. This court is left with the
conclusion, drawn by the district court, that counsel wilfully included
the baseless claims. If counsel wilfully files a baseless complaint, a
court may properly infer that it was filed either for purposes of
harassment, or some purpose other than to vindicate rights through the
judicial process. We therefore affirm the district court’s finding that
appellants violated the improper purpose prong of Rule 11.

In addition to relying upon the complaint itself, the district court
inferred an improper purpose from the timing of the filing of the
complaint, on the eve of the anniversary of the takeover of The
Robesonian, and some time after the alleged constitutional violations
began. The court also viewed with suspicion the timing and nature of the
dismissal of the complaint, which occurred after Jacobs lost his
extradition fight in the criminal case, and before any significant
discovery might have given notice to the plaintiffs that their claims
were not valid. The district court dismissed as incredible appellants’
explanations for dismissal, which contended that many of the claims had
become moot through a series of events. The district court found it
"absurd” to think that the wide-spread conspiracy involving high-level
state and public officials had suddenly become unimportant by May 2,
1989. The court noted that the basis of the complaint — the breach of
the alleged no-prosecution agreement — still existed even after
Hatcher’s and Jacobs’ guilty pleas to the state charges. The court
stated that the double jeopardy claims, damage claims, and other
requests for equitable relief, if ever valid, did not cease being valid.
In finding improper purpose, the district court was also influenced by
the outrageous nature of the claims made.

The affidavits submitted by counsel strongly disputed the court’s
conclusions as to the timing of the filing and of the dismissal of the
suit, and claimed that no improper motive influenced the timing of
events. As to the decision to dismiss, appellants argued that it was
based solely on financial considerations and the necessity of devoting
professional resources elsewhere. Appellants argue that many equitable
claims had become moot, and that the prospect for damages on the
remaining claims did not warrant the expense of continuing the suit.
However, the district court’s determination that these explanations are
not reasonable or believable, in light of all of the evidence
surrounding the filing of the complaint and the frivolous nature of the
allegations made, is not clearly erroneous.

The district court noted other evidence which suggested that appellants’
purpose in filing the complaint was not to vindicate plaintiffs’ rights,
such as appellants sending a copy of the complaint to the state judge
who likely would have tried Hatcher and Jacobs in the criminal case. The
court also noted a quotation reported by the media, in which Mr. Pitts
allegedly suggested that the suit was dropped after the Attorney
General’s office showed strong opposition to the suit. The court further
considered an affidavit by New York attorney Neal Rose concerning Mr.
Pitts’ alleged admission that the suit was commenced as leverage and
lacked a factual basis, although that affidavit was contradicted by an
affidavit by attorney Alan Rosenthal. In light of other evidence which
supports the court's finding of improper purpose, we cannot say that it
was an abuse of discretion for the court to consider these matters as
additional support, even though determinations of credibility are best
made after an evidentiary hearing.

In concluding that appellants had never intended to litigate their suit,
the district court also concluded that circumstances surrounding the
case, when viewed as a whole, supported the conclusion that appellants’
primary motives in filing the complaint were to gain publicity, to
embarrass state and county officials, to gain leverage in criminal
proceedings, to obtain discovery for use in criminal proceedings, and to
intimidate those involved in the prosecution of Hatcher and Jacobs. At
least some of these motives would not warrant sanctions under the
improper purpose portion of Rule 11, if appellants’ central purpose in
bringing suit had been to vindicate rights of the plaintiffs. Holding a
press conference to announce a lawsuit, while perhaps in poor taste, is
not grounds for a Rule 11 sanction, nor is a subjective hope by a
plaintiff that a lawsuit will embarrass or upset a defendant, so long as
there is evidence that a plaintiff’s central purpose in filing a
complaint was to vindicate rights through the judicial process. In this
case, however, there was no proper purpose for appellants’ filing of the
suit, and the district court’s consideration of other possible motives
for the suit based on the evidence available was proper.

We have affirmed the district court’s conclusion that sanctions were
warranted based on the improper purpose prong of Rule 11 because it is
not clearly erroneous and is supported by facts such as the baseless
allegations made, appellants’ legal experience, and the cumulative
nature of the evidence. However, we urge district courts to exercise
special caution when evaluating a signer’s purpose under Rule 11. When
there are issues of credibility, disputed questions of fact, and
rational explanations of purpose given, an evidentiary hearing may well
be necessary to resolve the issues. This is particularly true when large
sanctions are being considered on the ground of improper purpose as well
as failure to comply with the first two prongs of Rule 11. We do not
find that the court erred in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing in
this case, because the cumulative nature of the evidence, as well as our
earlier findings on the frivolousness of the allegations made in the
complaint and the lack of a legal or factual basis, convinces us that
the court’s finding of improper purpose is not clearly erroneous and
would not have been altered by an evidentiary hearing.

IV DUE PROCESS

Appellants argue that the district court should not have found a
violation of the "improper purpose” prong of Rule 11 without holding an
evidentiary hearing. We disagree. Due process does not require an
evidentiary hearing before sanctions are imposed, even when sanctions
are imposed in part under the improper purpose prong of Rule 11. The
Advisory Committee Note on Rule 11, indicates that satellite litigation
over sanctions and separate hearings should be limited to the extent
possible. "The court must to the extent possible limit the scope of the
sanction proceedings to the record.”

In determining whether and to what extent a hearing is required prior to
the imposition of sanctions, we are guided by the Advisory Committee
Note to Rule 11 and the reasoning of _Donaldson v. Clark_:

> The Advisory Committee Note indicates some of the matters to be
> considered: (1) the circumstances in general; (2) the type and
> severity of the sanction under consideration; and (3) the judge’s
> participation in the proceedings, the judge’s knowledge of the facts,
> and whether there is need for further inquiry. The Advisory Committee
> Note observes that "in many situations the judge’s participation in
> the proceedings provides him with full knowledge of the relevant facts
> and little further inquiry will be necessary.”
>
> When an attorney has failed to present necessary factual support for
> claims despite several opportunities to do so, for example, further
> hearing on the sanctions issue may well be not only unnecessary but
> also a waste of judicial resources. On the other hand, when a court is
> asked to resolve an issue of credibility or to determine whether a
> good faith argument can be made for the legal position taken, the risk
> of an erroneous imposition of sanctions under limited procedures and
> the probable value of additional hearing are likely to be greater.
> Prior opportunities to respond to Rule 11 charges will also influence
> the extent to which further hearing is necessary.
>
> As mentioned by the Advisory Committee, the type and severity of the
> sanction are necessary elements in the calculus. The more serious the
> possible sanction both in absolute size and in relation to actual
> expenditures, the more process that will be due.

Even if an evidentiary hearing is not required in every "improper
purpose” case, appellants argue that such hearing was required in this
case. Although the number of credibility determinations which the court
made without an evidentiary hearing should have suggested to the court
that an evidentiary hearing would have been of value, we affirm the
court's findings that appellants violated all three prongs of Rule 11
because the findings are not clearly erroneous even excluding some
evidence of "improper motive” which appellants contested.

The district judge’s participation in the proceedings was adequate to
give him full knowledge of the relevant facts without the necessity of
an evidentiary hearing. The district court had before it the pleadings,
the summary judgment motions of the state defendants and the 12(b)
motion of the county defendants. We also find that counsel were given an
adequate opportunity to contest the court’s determinations that Rule 11
was violated. The district court allowed appellants to submit
affidavits, and voluminous written legal arguments. The district judge
also heard oral argument. We find that due process requirements were
satisfied by the opportunities appellants were given to respond to the
charges that their complaint violated Rule 11.

However, although we find that counsel had an adequate opportunity to
contest the court’s finding that Rule 11 was violated, we find that
appellants were not given an adequate opportunity to respond to the type
and amount of sanction imposed, particularly in light of the large
monetary sanction. Appellants were given no opportunity to contest the
fee statements submitted, and the amount of the sanction was largely the
result of those statements. Under the facts of this case, particularly
the amount of the sanction, due process requires that appellants have
some opportunity to contest the amount of the sanction imposed. We
therefore vacate the sanction imposed. As discussed below, we vacate the
type and amount of sanction chosen by the district court for certain
additional reasons. On remand, under the guidelines set forth below the
appellants will be given an appropriate opportunity to respond to the
type and the amount of the sanction.

V AMOUNT OF SANCTION

A. Attorney Fees Portion

Rule 11 requires that "an appropriate sanction” be imposed upon those
who violate its requirements. Appellants argue that the amount of
sanctions was inappropriate, in part because the district court used the
Rule to shift fees and compensate the defendants, rather than to deter
improper litigation. We agree and vacate the amount of the monetary
sanction.

We have previously held that the least severe sanction adequate to serve
the purposes of Rule 11 should be imposed. It is clear that Rule 11
should not blindly be used to shift fees. In this instance, it appears
that the district court erred in assuming that "the first purpose of
sanctions under Rule 11 is to compensate the offended parties.” In
establishing the amount of the sanction, the district court improperly
focused on providing "compensatory sanctions.” The amount of expense
borne by opposing counsel in combatting frivolous claims may well be an
appropriate factor for a district court to consider in determining
whether a monetary sanction should issue and if so, in what amount.
However, it is clear that the primary, or "first” purpose of Rule 11 is
to deter future litigation abuse. A district court can and should bear
in mind that other purposes of the rule include compensating the victims
of the Rule 11 violation, as well as punishing present litigation abuse,
streamlining court dockets and facilitating court management. But the
amount of a monetary sanction should always reflect the primary purpose
of deterrence.

When a monetary award is issued, a district court should explain the
basis for the sanction so a reviewing court may have a basis to
determine whether the chosen sanction is appropriate. A district court
should consider the four factors recently enumerated by the Tenth
Circuit in _White v. General Motors Corp._: (1) the reasonableness of
the opposing party’s attorney’s fees; (2) the minimum to deter; (3) the
ability to pay; and (4) factors related to the severity of the Rule 11
violation.

> 1\) Reasonableness (lodestar) calculation. Because the sanction is
> generally to pay the opposing party’s "reasonable expenses including a
> reasonable attorney’s fee,” incurred because of the improper behavior,
> determination of this amount is the usual first step. The plain
> language of the rule requires that the court independently analyze the
> reasonableness of the requested fees and expenses. The injured party
> has a duty to mitigate costs by not overstaffing, overresearching or
> overdiscovering clearly meritless claims. In evaluating the
> reasonableness of the fee request, the district court should consider
> that the very frivolousness of the claim is what justifies the
> sanctions.

Attorney time which is attributed to responding to the media, or to
claims within a pleading which do not merit sanctions, should be
excluded from consideration. Only attorney time which is in response to
that which has been sanctioned should be evaluated. In this case, it is
appropriate for the court to consider on remand whether the large amount
of time devoted to the pursuit of sanctions was warranted, and whether
the injured parties failed to mitigate their costs by delaying their
pursuit of sanctions until after the dismissal. It would also be
appropriate for the district court to reduce the amount of any fees
awarded based on appellees’ failure to give earlier notice to appellants
that their conduct warranted Rule 11 sanctions. While the analysis of
the reasonableness of costs may call for fairly detailed affidavits,
this requirement is not intended to require evidentiary hearings.

Although amici curiae for appellants argue that sanctions based in whole
or in part on attorney's fees require the same procedures of discovery,
briefing, and argument allowed in attorney’s fees cases, we have already
stated that sanctions, unlike attorney’s fees, are not primarily
intended to compensate the prevailing party. Because the purposes of
sanctions differ from those of attorney’s fees, the amount of process
due the offending party differs.

The determination of the type or amount of the sanction imposed comes
only after the offending party has had an opportunity to defend against
the imposition of any sanction. Presumably, a party’s interest in the
kind and amount of a sanction is of less import than his or her interest
in the decision to impose any sanction. As stated, a district court is
required to choose the least severe sanction adequate to accomplish the
purpose of Rule 11. Thus, a monetary sanction should never be based
solely on the amount of attorney’s fees claimed by the injured party,
even where a court determines that the amount of the sanction should
equal the fees claimed by the injured party. As we have previously
stated, "reasonable” attorney’s fees in the context of Rule 11 "does not
necessarily mean actual expenses and attorney’s fees.” Because the
amount of a monetary sanction is not based solely on any claimed amount
of attorney's fees, but rather on all of the factors listed herein, the
risk of an erroneous calculation based on fee statements is less
troublesome in the context of a Rule 11 sanction than in attorney's fees
cases. We also bear in mind the interest in avoiding additional hearings
for purposes of calculating the amount of fees in the context of Rule
11. Given these considerations, we hold that a sanctioned party is not
entitled to an evidentiary hearing or to all of the procedural
safeguards available in the context of attorney's fees actions. Instead,
a district court may permit a sanctioned party to respond to an opposing
party's fee statements in its discretion. Of course, such discretion
must be exercised with proper considerations of due process. Where a
court determines that a large monetary sanction should issue, and the
amount is heavily influenced by an injured party's fee statements, as
was the case here, the court should permit the sanctioned party to
examine and contest the injured party's fee statements as an aid to the
court's own independent analysis of the reasonableness of the claimed
fees.

> 2\) Minimum to deter. As we have already stated, the primary purpose
> of sanctions is to deter attorney and litigant misconduct, not to
> compensate the opposing party for its costs in defending a frivolous
> suit. It is particularly inappropriate to use sanctions as a means of

> the rights of the attorney in question. The amount of sanctions is
> appropriate only when it is the "minimum that will serve to adequately
> deter the undesirable behavior.” Thus, the limit of any sanction award
> should be that amount reasonably necessary to deter the wrongdoer.

A district court must constantly bear in mind the limited purposes of
Rule 11, particularly in a case such as this, where a court may disagree
with aspects of counsel's conduct which fall outside of the scope of
Rule 11. Of course, a court must also constantly bear in mind that the
rule is not to chill the bringing of facially valid lawsuits, or a
lawyer's creativity in introducing novel theories of recovery.

> 3\. Ability to pay. The offender’s ability to pay must also be
> considered, not because it affects the egregiousness of the violation,

Although the burden is upon the parties being sanctioned to come forward
with evidence of their financial status, a monetary sanction imposed
without any consideration of ability to pay would constitute an abuse of
discretion. A court should refrain from imposing a monetary award so
great that it will bankrupt the offending parties or force them from the
future practice of law. Generally, the smaller the amount of the
monetary sanction imposed, the greater the likelihood that a court’s
consideration of the ability to pay will not want for lack of the formal
submission of evidence on a sanctioned party’s financial status. When
the monetary sanction is large, however, the parties should generally be
given the opportunity to submit affidavits on their financial status, or
to submit such other evidence as the court’s discretion permits. In this
case, the amount of the monetary sanction originally imposed was
substantial, and the parties should have been afforded the opportunity
to submit evidence on the issue of whether the amount imposed was so
great as to unfairly restrict their access to the courts or to otherwise
curtail their ability to practice law or to cause them great financial
distress.

> 4\. Other factors. In addition, the court may consider factors such as
> the offending party’s history, experience, and ability, the severity
> of the violation, the degree to which malice or bad faith contributed
> to the violation, the risk of chilling the type of litigation
> involved, and other factors as deemed appropriate in individual
> circumstances.

In this case, it is appropriate for the court to consider counsel’s vast
experience, the outrageous and scandalous nature of the claims made, and
the improper purpose of the lawsuit. A court might also increase a
sanction if one attorney has been previously sanctioned, because such
conduct might indicate that the previous sanction was not enough to
deter the repetition of the offense.

In addition to the four factors just stated, a district court must
sometimes consider whether joint and several liability is appropriate,
such as where sanctions are to be imposed against both a client and his
counsel. In this case, joint and several liability among attorneys, who
each signed a complaint in violation of Rule 11, was not inappropriate.
Each attorney has a duty to ensure that the pleading he has signed
comports with Rule 11. Issues of individual culpability do not arise
where each sanctioned party has committed the same Rule 11 violations.

B. Additional Sanctions

In addition to imposing sanctions in the amount of attorney's fees
claimed by the defendants, the district court imposed sanctions in the
amount of $10,000 upon each appellant based on his conduct in wilfully
filing outrageous claims and appellants’ "pains to publicize the
allegations through the media.” We believe this sanction was error. Rule
11 does not confine courts to any maximum monetary sanction, nor does it
even require courts to restrict themselves to monetary penalties.
However, Rule 11 must be accorded its plain meaning. The text of the
Rule clearly pertains only to a "pleading, motion, or other paper.” Rule
11 does not encompass all conduct within judicial proceedings, and it
clearly does not reach conduct outside of the judicial process. In this
case, it appears the court imposed sanctions in part based on
appellants’ publication of their baseless claims through the media.
While such publication may not be actionable as libel or slander, and is
reprehensible, Rule 11 was clearly not designed to encompass such
conduct.

CONCLUSION

In sum, we affirm the findings of the district court which led to the
imposition of Rule 11 sanctions in this case against plaintiffs’
attorneys. However, we vacate the sanction imposed, because it was based
on improper considerations and the size of the sanction required the
district court to allow sanctioned counsel an opportunity to respond, at
least to the fee statements on which the sanction was based. On remand,
the district court should consider the factors which we have adopted
prior to determining the sanction which should be imposed.

_Questions:_

1. Do you agree with the district court’s conclusion that Nakell,
 Pitts, and Kunstler violated Rule 11? Do you find Kunstler’s
 defense compelling?

2. Should courts impose Rule 11 sanctions on attorneys representing
 clients pro bono? Should they be more reluctant to impose
 sanctions?

_Pro Se_ Litigants_

Typically, courts exempt _pro se_ litigants from the requirements of
Rule 11. While many _pro se_ complaints are frivolous, some _pro se_
complaints are meritorious, and some have even caused dramatic changes
in the law. For example, in 1962, Clarence Earl Gideon filed a
handwritten _pro se_ petition for certiorari alleging that Florida had
violated his civil rights by denying him legal representation. The
Supreme Court granted his petition and held in [_Gideon v.
Wainwright_, 372 U.S. 335
(1963)](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1962/155) that the Sixth
Amendment guarantees criminal defendants the right to representation.

By contrast, [Jonathan Lee
Riches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Lee_Riches) filed
more than 2600 complaints while he was incarcerated at the Federal
Medical Center in Lexington, Kentucky, none of which were successful.
His complaints alleged improbable harms and requested unusual forms of
relief. For example, Riches filed a complaint alleging, _inter alia_,
tort claims against Michael Vick for stealing his dogs and using them
for dogfighting, then selling the dogs and using the proceeds to
purchase missiles from Iran. Among other things, Riches asked the court
to order Vick "to stop physically hurting my feelings and dashing my
hopes.” Eventually, the court prohibited Riches from filing any more
complaints _in forma pauperis_, meaning that he would have to pay filing
fees.

Questions:

1. How should courts evaluate _pro se_ filings?

2. Should courts apply Rule 11 to _pro se_ plaintiffs?
