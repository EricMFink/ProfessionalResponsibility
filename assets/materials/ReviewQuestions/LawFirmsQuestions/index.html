<p class="page-title">Law Firms &amp; Unauthorized Practice of Law</p>


<section id="question-1" class="level3">
<h3>Question 1</h3>
<p>Attorney Applebaum is recognized as an expert in securities
regulation law. Corporation retained Applebaum’s law firm to qualify
Corporation’s stock for public sale. After accepting the matter,
Applebaum decided that he preferred to spend his time on cases with
larger fee potential, so he assigned responsibility for the Corporation
matter to Attorney Becker, an associate in Applebaum’s office who had
recently been admitted to the bar. Becker protested to Applebaum that
he, Becker, knew nothing about securities regulation law and that he had
too little time to prepare himself to handle the Corp matter competently
without substantial help from Applebaum. Applebaum responded, “I don’t
have time to help you. Everyone has to start somewhere.” Applebaum
directed Becker to proceed. Was Applebaum’s conduct proper in this
matter?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Yes, because as a member of the bar, Becker is licensed to handle
any legal matter.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because Applebaum may withdraw from a case if work on it
would cause him unreasonable financial hardship.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because Applebaum knew Becker was not competent to handle the
matter, and Applebaum failed to provide supervision adequate to protect
the client’s interest.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because Corporation had not given Applebaum permission to
assign Becker to work on the matter.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-2" class="level3">
<h3>Question 2</h3>
<p>Attorney places Associate, recently admitted to the bar, in complete
charge of the work of the paralegals in Attorney’s office. That work
consisted of searching titles to real property, an area in which
Associate had no familiarity. Attorney instructed Associate to review
the searches prepared by the paralegals, and thereafter to sign
Attorney’s name to the required certifications of title if Associate was
satisfied that the search accurately reflected the condition of the
title. This arrangement enabled Attorney to lower office operating
expenses. Attorney told Associate that Associate should resolve any
legal questions that might arise and not to bother Attorney because
Attorney was too busy handling major litigation. Is it proper for
Attorney to assign Associate this responsibility?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Yes, if the paralegals are experienced in searching
titles.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because Attorney is ultimately liable for the accuracy of
the title searched.</p></li>
<li><p>No, unless it enables Attorney to charge lower fees for title
certification.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because Attorney is not adequately supervising the work of
Associate.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-3" class="level3">
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<p>Applebaum &amp; Becker, a general partnership, is a litigation firm
that hires new law school graduates as associates. These new lawyers are
largely left to their own resources to practice law. Applebaum &amp;
Becker accepts many small cases and assigns them to associates for
training purposes. No senior partners are assigned to supervise this
work. Client retained Applebaum &amp; Becker to pursue a claim for
breach of contract against City. Associate, a first year associate, was
assigned Client’s case. Associate failed to comply with the applicable
30-day notice requirement for filing a claim against City, and thus
Client lost the chance to recover $5,000. Which of the following
statements are correct?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The firm is subject to discipline for failure to supervise
Associate.</p></li>
<li><p>The individual partners of Applebaum &amp; Becker are subject to
discipline for failure to make reasonable efforts to establish a system
providing reasonable assurance that all lawyers in the firm comply with
the rules of professional conduct.</p></li>
<li><p>Associate is subject to discipline for incompetent
representation.</p></li>
<li><p>The partners and Associate are subject to civil liability for
Client’s loss.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-4" class="level3">
<h3>Question 4</h3>
<p>Associate was recently hired by the Smith Law Firm. Applebaum, a
partner at the Smith Law Firm, has asked Associate to draft a complaint
in a new case. Associate, who has researched the potential claims for
the complaint, concluded that the claims may be frivolous. Applebaum has
thoroughly reviewed Associate’s research and determined that, although
the claims are weak, they are not frivolous. Thus, Applebaum instructs
Associate to file the complaint.</p>
<p>If it turns out that the claims were frivolous, would Associate be
subject to discipline? Would Applebaum be subject to discipline?</p>
</section>
<section id="question-5" class="level3">
<h3>Question 5</h3>
<p>An attorney has a highly efficient staff of paraprofessional legal
assistants, all of whom are graduates of recognized legal assistant
educational programs. Recently, the statute of limitations ran against a
claim of a client of the attorney’s when a legal assistant negligently
misplaced the client’s file and suit was not filed within the time
permitted by law. Which of the following is correct?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The attorney is subject to civil liability and is also subject to
discipline on the theory of respondent superior.</p></li>
<li><p>The attorney is subject to civil liability or is subject to
discipline at the client’s election.</p></li>
<li><p>The attorney is subject to civil liability but is NOT subject to
discipline unless the attorney failed to supervise the legal assistant
adequately.</p></li>
<li><p>The attorney is NOT subject to civil liability and is NOT subject
to discipline if the attorney personally was not negligent.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-6" class="level3">
<h3>Question 6</h3>
<p>Law Firm hires Adele, a non-lawyer, to supervision all routine
administrative and financial matters for the firm. Adele reports to the
firm’s managing partner, who is also responsible for supervising the
firm’s associates. In addition to a monthly salary, Adele receives an
annual bonus bonus based on a percentage of the firm’s net income from
fees. Is this arrangement proper?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Yes, unless Adele has access to client files.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, if Adele does not control the professional judgment of the
lawyers in the firm.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because the law firm is sharing legal fees with a
nonlawyer.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because the law firm is assisting a nonlawyer in the
unauthorized practice of law.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-7" class="level3">
<h3>Question 7</h3>
<p>Law Firm, a professional corporation with five lawyer shareholders,
employs 25 additional lawyers. Which of the following are proper?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Employees who are members of the bar are not made shareholders
until they have been with Law Firm for 10 years.</p></li>
<li><p>Manager, who is the office manager and not a member of the bar,
is executive vice president of Law Firm.</p></li>
<li><p>Widow, whose husband was a lawyer shareholder in Law Firm until
his death two years ago, continues to hold husband’s shares in Law Firm
until their child finishes law school.</p></li>
<li><p>All of the above.</p></li>
<li><p>None of the above.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-8" class="level3">
<h3>Question 8</h3>
<p>Acton, a certified public accountant, has proposed to Attorney, a
recognized specialist in the field of tax law, that Acton and Attorney
form a partnership for the purpose of providing clients with tax-related
legal and accounting services. Both Acton and Attorney have deserved
reputations for being competent, honest, and trustworthy. Acton further
proposes that the announcement of the proposed partnership, the firm
stationery, and all public directory listings clearly state that Acton
is a certified public accountant and that Attorney is a lawyer. Is
Attorney subject to discipline if he enters into the proposed
partnership with Acton?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Yes, because one of the activities of the partnership would be
providing legal services to clients.</li>
<li>Yes, because Attorney would be receiving fees paid for other than
legal services.</li>
<li>No, because the partnership will assure to the public high-quality
services in the fields of tax law and accounting.</li>
<li>No, if Attorney is the only person in the partnership who gives
advice on legal matters.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-9" class="level3">
<h3>Question 9</h3>
<p>Same facts as previous question, but the partnership will be
providing only accounting services. Is Attorney subject to
discipline?</p>
</section>
<section id="question-10" class="level3">
<h3>Question 10</h3>
<p>Dewey, a lawyer, has just joined the Law Offices of Applebaum and
Becker, a professional corporation engaged solely in the practice of
law. Dewey is a salaried associate and is not a member or shareholder of
the professional corporation. Applebaum’s spouse, Wickersham, who is not
a lawyer, is vice-president of the corporation and office manager. All
of the other officers are lawyers in the firm. All of the corporate
shares are held by lawyers in the corporation, except for ten shares
held by the executor under the will of a lawyer-member who died one
month previously and whose will is now being probated. Dewey knows that
Wickersham is an officer and not a lawyer.</p>
<p>Is Dewey subject to discipline?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Yes, because Wickersham is an officer of the
corporation.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, if a nonlawyer holds the stock as the executor of the will
of the deceased member.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because Dewey is a salaried employee and not a member or
shareholder of the corporation.</p></li>
<li><p>No, if Wickersham does not participate in any decision regarding
a client or a client’s case.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-11" class="level3">
<h3>Question 11</h3>
<p>Attorney has recently started her own law firm with four other
lawyers as associates. The law firm has moved into an office in a new
building which is owned by Bank. Attorney has borrowed heavily from Bank
to finance her new law firm. In addition, Bank provides the law firm
with accounting services through its computer. At Bank’s suggestion, an
employee of Bank, who is not a lawyer, serves as a part-time office
manager for the law firm without compensation from the firm. The duties
of the office manager are to advise the firm generally on fees and time
charges, program matters for the computer services, and consult with
Attorney on accounting and billing practices to ensure solvency.</p>
<p>Is the arrangement with Bank proper?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Yes, unless secrets or confidences of clients may be disclosed to
Bank.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because the office manager is paid by Bank.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because a nonlawyer will be advising the law firm on fees and
time charges.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because Bank’s employee is involved in management of the law
firm, without supervision by the firm’s attorneys.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-12" class="level3">
<h3>Question 12</h3>
<p>Attorney is a member of the bar and a salaried employee of the trust
department of Bank. As part of his duties, he prepares a monthly
newsletter concerning wills and taxes which Bank sends to all of its
customers. The newsletter contains a recommendation to the customer to
review his or her will in light of information contained therein and, if
the customer has any questions, to bring the will to Bank’s trust
department where a non-lawyer trust officer will answer any questions
without charge. If the trust officer is unable to answer the customer’s
questions, the trust officer refers the customer to Attorney.</p>
<p>Is Attorney subject to discipline?</p>
</section>
<section id="question-13" class="level3">
<h3>Question 13</h3>
<p>Plaintiff, who is not a lawyer, is representing himself in small
claims court in an action to recover his security deposit from his
former landlord. Plaintiff told Attorney, a close friend who lived
nearby him, about this case, but did not ask Attorney for any advice.
Attorney said, “I’ll give you some free advice. It would help your case
if the new tenants would testify that the apartment was in good shape
when they moved in, and, contrary to the allegation of your former
landlord, it was not, in fact, repainted for them.” Plaintiff followed
Attorney’s advice and won his case.</p>
<p>Is Attorney subject to discipline for assisting Plaintiff in
preparing for his court appearance?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Yes, because Attorney assisted Plaintiff in the practice of
law.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because Attorney offered unsolicited, in-person legal
advice.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because Plaintiff was representing himself in the
proceedings.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because Attorney was not compensated for his advice.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-14" class="level3">
<h3>Question 14</h3>
<p>Attorney Adelman represents the wife in a marriage dissolution
proceeding that involves bitterly contested issues of property division
and child custody. The husband is represented by another lawyer, Lehrer.
After one day of trial, the husband, through Lehrer, made a settlement
offer. Because of the husband’s intense dislike for Adelman, the
proposed settlement requires that Adelman agree not to represent the
wife in any subsequent proceeding, brought by either party, to modify or
enforce the provisions of the decree. The wife wants to accept the
offer, and Adelman believes that the settlement offer made by the
husband is better than any award the wife would get if the case went to
judgment.</p>
<p>Is it proper for Adelman to agree that she will not represent the
wife in any subsequent proceeding?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Yes, because the restriction on Adelman is limited to subsequent
proceedings in the same matter.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, if Adelman believes that it is in the wife’s best interests
to accept the proposed settlement.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because the proposed settlement would restrict Adelman’s
right to represent the wife in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>No, unless Adelman believes that the wife’s interests can be
adequately protected by another lawyer in the future.</p></li>
</ol>

<section id="question-15" class="level3">
<h3>Question 15</h3>
<p>Upon graduating law school, Dewey is hired by the law firm of
Applebaum &amp; Becker, located in the city of Metropolis. Applebaum, a
partner at the firm, asks Dewey to sign an employment contract. The
contract contains the following clause: “Upon terminating employment,
Dewey agrees not to practice law at any firm within two miles of
Metropolis for a period of one year.”</p>
<ul>

<section id="question-16" class="level3">
<h3>Question 16</h3>
<p>Applebaum &amp; Becker is a law firm specializing in real estate
transactions. For years, Applebaum &amp; Becker has used independent
title insurance companies for its clients’ real estate closings. The
firm is considering starting its own title insurance company, which will
be incorporated separately from the law firm but will be housed in the
same building.</p>
<p>May the firm do so and what steps should it take to avoid violation
of Rule 5.7?</p>
</section>
<section id="question-17" class="level3">
<h3>Question 17</h3>
<p>The Applebaum Law Firm’s estate planning department has been losing
money for years. Consequently, the firm decides to sell its entire
estate planning practice—including all estate planning clients—to the
Becker Law Firm, which specializes in estate planning.</p>
<ul>
<li>What duties does the Applebaum firm owe to its estate planning
clients?</li>
<li>May the Applebaum firm sell only those clients with assets below $1
million?</li>
<li>May the Becker firm defray the acquisition costs by raising fees on
clients it receives from Applebaum?</li>
</ul>
