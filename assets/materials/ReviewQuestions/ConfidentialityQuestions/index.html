<section id="question-1" class="level3">
<h3>Question 1</h3>
<p>In 1985, you represented A. A and B were accused of killing V. Prior
to trial, A confessed to you that he (A) was the sole killer of V and
that B was not involved. You believe A’s confession was truthful. A’s
confession was not disclosed at trial. As a result, both A and B were
convicted of murder and both were sentenced to life in prison. In 2002,
A commits suicide in prison. In 2003, B moves for a new trial. You are
convinced that B is innocent, so you wish to voluntarily testify at the
B’s hearing about your 1985 conversation with A in which A confessed to
being the sole murderer.</p>
<p>Should you do so?</p>
</section>
<section id="question-2" class="level3">
<h3>Question 2</h3>
<p>Your long-time client, John Carter, recently came to your office to
tell you that he expects to be sued by the person who bought his house.
He had told the buyer that the house had a dry basement. Although the
basement had never flooded in the five years that he had lived there,
Carter had been told by a prior owner that the basement regularly
flooded after a heavy rain. There was such a rain this year, and the
buyer’s furniture was destroyed.</p>
<p>Shortly before his death, you were able to interview the prior owner
of the house, who told you what he had told Carter about the flooding.
You have notes of that interview in which you comment on the former
owner’s likely credibility at trial. In addition, while at a party,
Carter’s banker let slip that Carter is in bad financial condition. The
buyer has now filed suit against Carter.</p>
<ul>
<li>The buyer has subpoenaed you to give a deposition. What information
must you disclose?</li>
<li>The buyer has subpoenaed any documents you have related to the case.
What must you disclose?</li>
<li>One of your college friends, who is about to loan money to Carter,
has informally asked you about Carter’s financial condition. You would
like to help your college friend. What may you disclose?</li>
<li>If Carter is compelled to testify at trial, may he use the
attorney-client privilege as a basis for refusing to disclose the
conversation he had with the prior owner?</li>
</ul>

<p>In a federal investigation of Defendant for tax fraud, the grand jury
by subpoena requests a letter written January 15 by Defendant to her
attorney in which she stated: “Please prepare a deed giving my ranch to
University but, in order to get around the tax law, I want it back-dated
to December 15.”</p>
<p>Must attorney produce the letter?</p>

<p>May Attorney do so?</p>
</section>
<section id="question-6" class="level3">
<h3>Question 6</h3>
<p>On June 1, Owner consults Attorney about a motor vehicle collision
resulting in a suit by P against Owner. Attorney calls E, an expert he
has hired to testify in this case, into the conference to make notes of
what is said, and those present discuss the facts of the collision. A
few weeks later, Attorney is subpoenaed by the grand jury and asked to
disclose the substance of her June 1 conversation with Owner.</p>
<p>Must Attorney disclose such information?</p>

<p>Must G produce the records?</p>
</section>
<section id="question-8" class="level3">
<h3>Question 8</h3>
<p>An attorney represents a company that produces chemical products.
Some of the waste products that the company manufactures are highly
toxic and are likely to cause serious immediate physical harm if
disposed of improperly. The president of the company recently informed
the attorney that a new employee mistakenly disposed of the waste
products in the ground behind the company plant, an area that is part of
the source of the city’s water supply. The attorney advised the
president that the company could be liable for negligence in lawsuits
brought by any persons harmed by the waste products. As a result, the
attorney advised the president to immediately report the problem to city
authorities. Fearful of adverse publicity, the president declined to do
so. The attorney further advised the president that she believed the
president’s decision was immoral. The president continued to decline to
report the matter. The attorney then informed the president that she was
withdrawing from the representation and would inform the authorities
herself. Immediately after withdrawing, the attorney reported the
company’s conduct to the authorities.</p>
<p>Is the attorney subject to discipline?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Yes, because the information was given to the attorney in
confidence and may not be revealed without the client’s
consent.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, unless the company’s conduct was criminal.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because the attorney reasonably believed that the company’s
disposal of the waste products was likely to cause serious physical
harm.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because the attorney reasonably believed that the president
was pursuing an imprudent course of conduct.</p></li>
</ol>

<section id="question-9" class="level3">
<h3>Question 9</h3>
<p>Attorney represented Client in a large real estate deal. Buyer, who
purchased the real estate from Client, has filed suit against both
Client and Attorney, alleging fraud. Attorney had advised Client by
letter against making the statements relied upon by Buyer as the basis
of Buyer’s claim. In her defense to Buyer’s suit, Attorney wishes to
reveal confidential information imparted to Attorney by Client that will
be favorable to Attorney but damaging to Client.</p>
<p>May Attorney do so?</p>

represent him. Client visits Lawyer for a free initial consultation.
During the meeting, Client admits guilt. At the end of the meeting,
however, Client decides not to hire Lawyer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is Lawyer required or allowed to disclose Client’s admission of
guilt?</li>
<li>What if, unbeknownst to Client, Lawyer had never passed the bar exam
and thus was not a licensed attorney?</li>
</ul>

<li><p>Both</p></li>
<li><p>Neither</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-12" class="level3">
<h3>Question 12</h3>
<p>You are a public defender representing Jerry Cashwell, who has been
charged with murder. Based on witness statements, the police and
prosecutor believe that another man, Lee Hunt, planned the murder and
that Cashwell acted as Hunt’s accomplice in carrying out the killing. To
avoid any potential conflict, the court has appointed another lawyer to
represent Hunt.</p>
<p>During your initial meeting with Cashwell, he tells you, “I killed
that guy all on my own. Hunt didn’t have anything to do with it.” Based
on the details that Cashwell provides about the crime, and the lack of
any apparent motive to falsely claim sole responsibility, you conclude
that Cashwell is telling the truth.</p>
<p><em>What are your obligations under Rule 1.6(a)? Do any of the
exceptions under Rule 1.6(b) apply at this point?</em></p>
<p>Cashwell and Hunt are tried separately. At Hunt’s trial, he testifies
that he had no role in the crime. Nevertheless, Hunt is convicted and
sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>
<p>Following Hunt’s conviction, you reach an agreement with the
prosecution under which Cashwell will plead guilty to the murder charge
and receive a life sentence. The prosecutor tells you they are offering
this deal, “because we know Cashwell &amp; Hunt acted together”. You
notify Cashwell of the plea offer and explain to him that, if he goes to
trial and it comes out that he acted alone, he would likely face the
death penalty. Cashwell accepts the deal and enters a guilty plea. At
Cashwell’s allocution, he does not reveal that Hunt had no
involvement.</p>
<p><em>Do you have any obligation to correct the prosecutor’s mistaken
belief about Hunt’s involvement in the murder? Do you have any
obligation to inform the court that Hunt was not involved?</em></p>
<p>About ten years later, Cashwell commits suicide in prison. Hunt
remains in prison serving his life sentence.</p>
<p><em>Does MRPC Rule 1.6 permit you to reveal Cashwell’s admission of
sole responsbility to Hunt’s attorney now that Cashwell is
dead?</em></p>
<p><em>Does NC Rule 8.6 permit or require disclosure?</em></p>
