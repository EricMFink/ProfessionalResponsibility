<p class="page-title">Discussion Problem</p>

<p class="page-subtitle">Conflicts</p>


<p>(Based on <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/the-tenant-and-the-motive-9780747578970/">Javier
Cercas, <em>The Motive</em></a>.)</p>
<p>Álvaro is a lawyer and writer. He is working on a new novel, about a
young couple experiencing sudden financial hardship, who decide to kill
their elderly neighbor and steal the money he keeps in a safe in his
apartment. The characters are based on Álvaro’s neighbors, the young
couple Enrique &amp; Irene Cesares and the elderly Señor Montero. For
inspiration, Álvaro has been listening in on his neighbors’
conversations, which he can overhear from the bathroom of his
apartment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Enrique Cesares is laid off from his job, and he asks
Álvaro whether he has any legal grounds to contest the layoff. Seeing an
opportunity to get more insight into his characters, Álvaro agrees to
help. The following excerpt from <em>The Motive</em> discusses Álvaro’s
work on the case and his subsequent discussion with Enrique Cesares:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For some time, the writing of the novel was put on hold. Álvaro
spared no effort in studying Enrique Cesares’ case. He obtained all the
relevant information, examined it carefully, studied it, revised it
several times, checked the case against other analogous ones. He arrived
at the conclusion that, in effect, it would be possible to appeal
against the [layoff], with a virtual guarantee of success. In the worst
case, the severance pay the company should be obliged to provide if the
dismissal was carried out was almost double the paltry sum his neighbor
had been offered.</p>
<p>Once the situation was clarified, he reflected cautiously. He
considered two options:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>If he appealed the dismissal it was very likely Cesares would
manage to keep his job or, at least, that the damage would be far
less—on the hypothesis that the company might choose to resort to a
paragraph of the law which stated that they had no obligation to readmit
a dismissed employee to his post. In this case—Álvaro continues—I will
have won Cesares’ gratitude, but I will also have lost time and money,
since I have no intention of sinking so low as to charge him a
fee.</p></li>
<li><p>If he allowed events to take their natural course, without
intervening in them, he would still gain his neighbor’s friendship and
appreciation, given that he would understand and respect all the
disinterested attention Álvaro had devoted to his problem. Besides,
Álvaro wouldn’t charge him a cent for all the time generously spent on
it. On the other hand, it was certain that the loss of his job—their
only source of sustenance—would have repercussions on the couple’s
relationship, which might deteriorate in such a way as to make possible
that he, Álvaro, might be able to expect to hear, from his surveillance
post by the ventilation window, the vicissitudes of that process of
deterioration, which he’d undoubtedly be able to use in his novel. This
would facilitate his work enormously as he would enjoy the possibility,
so long nurtured, of obtaining from the couple the material he needed to
proceed with and conclude his work.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>He arranged to see Cesares. He explained the steps he’d taken, his
investigations at the ministry and the union, illustrated the situation
with analogous examples, clarified the various juridical details, added
data the factory had supplied. Finally, he invented interviews and lied
coldly.</p>
<p>He concluded, “I don’t think there’s the slightest chance they’ll
accept the appeal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Was Álvaro’s conduct proper under Rules 1.7 &amp; 1.8?</p>
<p>Does Álvaro’s conduct breach any other obligations under the Model
Rules?</p>
