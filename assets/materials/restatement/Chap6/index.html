<h6>f. Advice about enforcement policy. A lawyer’s advice to a client
about the degree of risk that a law violation will be detected or
prosecuted violates the rule of Subsection (2) when the circumstances
indicate that the lawyer thereby intended to counsel or assist the
client’s crime, fraud, or violation of a court order.</h6>

<h6>No bright-line rule immunizes the lawyer from adverse legal
consequences. In many borderline situations, the lawyer’s intent will be
a disputable question of fact (see Comments a &amp; c), as will be
questions of the lawyer’s knowledge (see Comment g). Such questions will
be determined from all the circumstances. In general, a lawyer may
advise a client about enforcement policy in areas of doubtful legality
so long as the lawyer does not knowingly counsel or assist the client to
engage in criminal or fraudulent activity or activity that violates a
court order. Clearly, such advice is permissible when the lawyer knows
that nonenforcement amounts to effective abandonment of the prohibition
and not simply temporary dereliction on the part of enforcing
authorities or ignorance on their part of sufficient facts to bring an
enforcement proceeding.</h6>

<h6>1. Client plays cards with friends in Client’s home and asks Lawyer
whether it would be illegal for the players to place small bets on the
games. Lawyer knows that a criminal statute prohibiting gambling
literally applies to such betting. Lawyer also knows that as a matter of
long-standing policy and practice, persons who gamble on social games
played in private homes for small stakes are not prosecuted. Lawyer may
advise Client about the nonenforcement policy and practice.</h6>

<h6>2. Lawyer reasonably believes that Client has a nonfrivolous basis
for asserting on state income-tax returns that Client’s use of a
personal automobile is for a business purpose and thus that related
expenses are a proper deduction. Among other things, Lawyer has advised
Client concerning the likelihood of an audit by tax authorities if
Client takes the intended deduction. Lawyer bases the assessment of
audit likelihood on published figures showing the incidence of audits
for automobile use for taxpayers at Client’s income level. In the course
of that discussion, Client also asks Lawyer what the average taxpayer at
Client’s income level deducts for charitable contributions in a year
without incurring an audit. From prior dealings with Client, Lawyer
knows that Client seldom makes charitable contributions and in past
years has not made contributions of more than a few dollars. In the
circumstances, Lawyer’s advice about enforcement policy concerning the
automobile use was appropriate within Subsection (2). While the facts
stated above suggest that advice concerning enforcement policy for
charitable deductions would not be permissible, whether under all the
facts Lawyer may so advise Client depends on whether Lawyer reasonably
believes that Client will likely use Lawyer’s advice to claim false
deductions.</h6>

<h6>e. A constituent’s breach of a legal obligation to the client
organization. A lawyer representing an organization is required to act
with reasonable competence and diligence in the representation (see §
16(2)) and to use care in representing the organizational client (see §
50). The lawyer thus must not knowingly or negligently assist any
constituent to breach a legal duty to the organization. However, a
lawyer’s duty of care to the organization is not limited to avoidance of
assisting acts that threaten injury to a client. A lawyer is also
required to act diligently and to exercise care by taking steps to
prevent reasonably foreseeable harm to a client. Thus, Subsection (2)
requires a lawyer to take action to protect the interests of the client
organization with respect to certain breaches of legal duty to the
organization by a constituent.</h6>

<h6>The lawyer is not prevented by rules of confidentiality from acting
to protect the interests of the organization by disclosing within the
organization communications gained from constituents who are not
themselves clients. That follows even if disclosure is against the
interests of the communicating person, of another constituent whose
breach of duty is in issue, or of other constituents (see § 131, Comment
e). Such disclosure within the organization is subject to direction of a
constituent who is authorized to act for the organization in the matter
and who is not complicit in the breach (see Comment d). The lawyer may
withdraw any support that the lawyer may earlier have provided the
intended act, such as by withdrawing an opinion letter or draft
transaction documents prepared by the lawyer.</h6>

<h6>1. Lawyer represents Charity, a not-for-profit corporation. Charity
promotes medical research through tax-deductible contributions made to
it. President as chief executive officer of Charity retained Lawyer to
represent Charity as outside general counsel and has extensively
communicated in confidence with Lawyer on a variety of matters
concerning Charity. President asks Lawyer to draft documents by which
Charity would make a gift of a new luxury automobile to a social friend
of President. In that and all other work, Lawyer represents only Charity
and not President as a client. Lawyer concludes that such a gift would
cause financial harm to Charity in violation of President’s legal duties
to it. Lawyer may not draft the documents. If unable to dissuade
President from effecting the gift, Lawyer must take action to protect
the interests of Charity (see Subsection (2) &amp; Comment f). Lawyer
may, for example, communicate with members of Charity’s board of
directors in endeavoring to prevent the gift from being
effectuated.</h6>

<h6>f. Proceeding in the best interests of the client organization.
Within the meaning of Subsection (2), a wrongful act of a constituent
threatening substantial injury to a client organization may be of two
types. One is an act or failure to act that violates a legal obligation
to the organization and that would directly harm the organization, such
as by unlawfully converting its assets. The other is an act or failure
to act by the constituent that, although perhaps intended to serve an
interest of the organization, will foreseeably cause injury to the
client, such as by exposing the organization to criminal or civil
liability.</h6>

<h6>In either circumstance, as stated in Subsection (2), if the
threatened injury is substantial the lawyer must proceed in what the
lawyer reasonably believes to be the best interests of the organization.
Those interests are normally defined by appropriate managers of the
organization in the exercise of the business and managerial judgment
that would be exercised by a person of ordinary prudence in a similar
position. The lawyer’s duty of care is that of an ordinarily prudent
lawyer in such a position (see ALI Principles of Corporate Governance:
Analysis and Recommendations § 4.01, at 148-149 (1994)). In the face of
threats of substantial injury to the organization of the kind described
in Subsection (2), the lawyer must assess the following: the degree and
imminence of threatened financial, reputational, and other harms to the
organization; the probable results of litigation that might ensue
against the organization or for which it would be financially
responsible; the costs of taking measures within the organization to
prevent or correct the harm; the likely efficaciousness of measures that
might be taken; and similar considerations.</h6>

<h6>The measures that a lawyer may take are those described in
Subsection (3), among others. Whether a lawyer has proceeded in the best
interests of the organization is determined objectively, on the basis of
the circumstances reasonably apparent to the lawyer at the time. Not all
lawyers would attempt to resolve a problem defined in Subsection (2) in
the same manner. Not all threats to an organization are of the same
degree of imminence or substantiality. In some instances the constituent
may be acting solely for reasons of self-interest. In others, the
constituent may act on the basis of a business judgment whose utility or
prudence may be doubtful but that is within the authority of the
constituent. The lawyer’s assessment of those factors may depend on the
constituent’s credibility and intentions, based on prior dealings
between them and other information available to the lawyer.</h6>

<h6>The appropriate measures to take are ordinarily a matter for the
reasonable judgment of the lawyer, with due regard for the circumstances
in which the lawyer must function. Those circumstances include such
matters as time and budgetary limitations and limitations of access to
additional information and to persons who may otherwise be able to act.
If one measure fails, the lawyer must, if the nature of the threat
warrants and circumstances permit, take other reasonably available
measures. With respect to the lawyer’s possible liability to the
organizational client, failure to take a particular remedial step is
tested under the general standard of § 50. When the lawyer reasonably
concludes that any particular step would not likely advance the best
interests of the client, the step need not be taken.</h6>

<h6>Several options are described in Subsection (3). The lawyer may be
able to prevent the wrongful act or its harmful consequences by urging
reconsideration by the constituent who intends to commit the act. The
lawyer may also suggest that the organization obtain a second legal or
other expert opinion concerning the questioned activity. It may be
appropriate to refer the matter to someone within the organization
having authority to prevent the prospective harm, such as an official in
the organization senior in authority to the constituent threatening to
act. In appropriate circumstances, the lawyer may request intervention
by the highest executive authority in the organization or by its
governing body, such as a board of directors or the independent
directors on the board, or by an owner of a majority of the stock in the
organization. In determining how to proceed, the lawyer may be guided by
the organization’s internal policies and lines of authority or channels
of communication.</h6>

from the representation without attempting to prevent the constituent’s
wrongful act. However, the lawyer’s threat to withdraw unless corrective

attempt.</h6>

<h6>If a lawyer has attempted appropriately but unsuccessfully to
protect the best interests of the organizational client, the lawyer may
withdraw if permissible under § 32. Particularly when the lawyer has
unsuccessfully sought to enlist assistance from the highest authority
within the organization, the lawyer will be warranted in withdrawing
either because the client persists in a course of action involving the
lawyer’s services that the lawyer reasonably believes is criminal or
fraudulent (see § 32(3)(d)) or because the client insists on taking
action that the lawyer considers repugnant or imprudent (see §
32(3)(f)). On proportionality between certain grounds for withdrawal and
possible harm to the organizational client that would be caused by
withdrawal, see § 32, Comment h(i). On the circumstances in which a
lawyer is required to withdraw, see § 32(2). Following withdrawal, if
the lawyer had fulfilled applicable duties prior to withdrawal, the
lawyer has no further duty to initiate action to protect the interests
of the client organization with respect to the matter. The lawyer
continues to be subject to the duties owed to any former client, such as
the duty not to become involved in subsequent adverse representations
(see § 132) or otherwise to use or disclose the former client’s
confidential information adversely to the former client (see § 60).</h6>

to persons outside the organization is determined primarily under §§
66-67 (see also §§ 61-64). In limited circumstances, it may clearly
appear that limited disclosure to prevent or limit harm would be in the
interests of the organizational client and that constituents who purport
to forbid disclosure are not authorized to act for the organization.

<h6>g. A constituent’s breach of fiduciary duty to another constituent.
One constituent of an organization may owe fiduciary duties to another
such constituent, for example in some instances a majority stockholder
to a minority holder. A lawyer representing only the organization has no
duty to protect one constituent from another, including from a breach by
one constituent of such fiduciary duties, unless the interests of the
lawyer’s client organization are at risk. On communicating with a
nonclient constituent, see § 103, Comment e. However, if the lawyer
represents as a client either the entity or the constituent owing
fiduciary duties, the lawyer may not counsel or assist a breach of any
fiduciary obligation owed by the constituent to the organization.</h6>

<h6>2. Lawyer represents Client, a closely held corporation, and not any
constituent of Client. Under law applicable to the corporation, a
majority shareholder owes a fiduciary duty of fair dealing to a minority
shareholder in a transaction caused by action of a board of directors
whose members have been designated by the majority stockholder. The law
provides that the duty is breached if the action detrimentally and
substantially affects the value of the minority shareholder’s stock.
Majority Shareholder has asked the board of directors of Client,
consisting of Majority Shareholder’s designees, to adopt a plan for
buying back stock of the majority’s shareholders in Client. A minority
shareholder has protested the plan as unfair to the minority
shareholder. Lawyer may advise the board about the position taken by the
minority shareholder, but is not obliged to advise against or otherwise
seek to prevent action that is consistent with the board’s duty to
Client.</h6>

<h6>c. Identity of a governmental client. No universal definition of the
client of a governmental lawyer is possible. For example, it has been
asserted that government lawyers represent the public, or the public
interest. However, determining what individual or individuals personify
the government requires reference to the need to sustain political and
organizational responsibility of governmental officials, as well as the
organizational arrangements structured by law within which governmental
lawyers work. Those who speak for the governmental client may differ
from one representation to another. The identity of the client may also
vary depending on the purpose for which the question of identity is
posed. For example, when government lawyers negotiate a disputed
question of departmental jurisdiction between two federal agencies, it
is not helpful to refer to the client of each of the lawyers as “the
federal government” or “the public” when considering who is empowered to
direct the lawyers’ activities. For many purposes, the preferable
approach on the question presented is to regard the respective agencies
as the clients and to regard the lawyers working for the agencies as
subject to the direction of those officers authorized to act in the
matter involved in the representation (see Subsection (3)).</h6>

<h6>Government agencies exist in various forms, ranging from departments
or governmental corporations that may sue and be sued in their own
names, to divisions of government without such separate legal status, to
legislatures or committees of legislatures. If a question arises
concerning which of several possible governmental entities a government
lawyer represents, the identity of the lawyer’s governmental client
depends on the circumstances. Relevant are such factors as the terms of
retention or other manifestations of the reasonable understanding of the
lawyer and the hiring authority involved, the anticipated scope and
nature of the lawyer’s services, particular regulatory arrangements
relevant to the lawyer’s work, and the history and traditions of the
office (see also § 96, Comment h).</h6>

in that person’s public (see Comment b) or private (nongovernmental)
capacity, the person (in the appropriate capacity) is the client, unless
the use of the individual’s name is merely nominal and the government is
the interested party. As described above with respect to multiple
agencies, the identity and the specification of the capacity of the
person represented by the lawyer is determined by the undertaking and
reasonable expectations of both the lawyer and individual (see § 14). A
lawyer who represents a governmental official in the person’s public
capacity must conduct the representation to advance public interests as
determined by appropriate governmental officers and not, if different,
the personal interests of the occupant of the office (see generally
Comment f).</h6>

<h6>Wrongful acts of a constituent of a governmental client that require
or permit a governmental lawyer to take remedial action under Subsection
(2) include any act that would violate law applicable to the client and
that would cause substantial private or public injury. Injury to the
property interests of the client, for example by reason of the
constituent’s unlawful conversion of public funds, results in a
violation of the government’s legal rights. In addition, the public
interest in the integrity of government may reasonably lead a lawyer to
conclude, for example, that misappropriation of a small sum warrants
remedial action for the government that might not be warranted for a
nongovernmental client. Unlawful acts of a governmental official may
also violate the nonproprietary rights of third persons—such as
depriving them of the right to vote or of the right to be free of racial
or gender discrimination. When a lawyer is required to act to protect
the best interests of a governmental client (compare § 96, Comment f),
those interests are defined with reference to applicable constitutional,
statutory, and regulatory definitions of the objectives and
responsibilities of the governmental client.</h6>

<h6>d. Subsequently discovered falsity. A lawyer who has made a
representation on behalf of a client reasonably believing it true when
made may subsequently come to know of its falsity. An obligation to
disclose before consummation of the transaction ordinarily arises,
unless the lawyer takes other corrective action. See Restatement Second,
Agency § 348, Comment c; Restatement Second, Contracts § 161(a)
(nondisclosure as equivalent to assertion when person “knows that
disclosure of the fact is necessary to prevent some previous assertion
from being a misrepresentation or from being fraudulent or material”).
Disclosure, being required by law (see § 63), is not prohibited by the
general rule of confidentiality (see § 60). Disclosure should not exceed
what is required to comply with the disclosure obligation, for example
by indicating to recipients that they should not rely on the lawyer’s
statement. On permissive disclosure to prevent or rectify a client’s
wrongful act, see §§ 66-67.</h6>

<h6>f. Prohibited forms of communication. Under the anti-contact rule of
this Section, a lawyer ordinarily is not authorized to communicate with
a represented nonclient even by letter with a copy to the opposite
lawyer or even if the opposite lawyer wrongfully fails to convey
important information to that lawyer’s client (see § 20), such as a
settlement offer. The rule prohibits all forms of communication, such as
sending a represented nonclient a copy of a letter to the nonclient’s
lawyer or causing communication through someone acting as the agent of
the lawyer (see § 5(2) &amp; Comment f thereto) (prohibition against
violation of duties through agents). The anti-contact rule applies to
any communication relating to the lawyer’s representation in the matter,
whoever initiates the contact and regardless of the content of the
ensuing communication.</h6>

<h6>h. A represented nonclient accused or suspected of a crime.
Controversy has surrounded the question whether prosecutors are fully
subject to the rule of this Section with respect to contact, prior to
indictment, with represented nonclients accused or suspected of crime.
Certain considerations favor a relaxed anti-contact rule.
Law-enforcement officials traditionally have resorted to undercover
means of gathering important evidence. If retention of a lawyer alone
precluded direct prosecutorial contact, a knowledgeable criminal suspect
could obtain immunity from otherwise lawful forms of investigation by
retaining a lawyer, while unsophisticated suspects would have no similar
protection. Moreover, nonlawyer law-enforcement personnel such as the
police are not subject to the rule of this Section. Rigidly extending
the anti-contact rule to prosecutors would create unfortunate incentives
to eliminate them from involvement in investigations.</h6>

<h6>On the other hand, certain considerations argue in favor of an
anti-contact rule for prosecutors. They are in a position to overreach
suspects or interfere in client-lawyer relationships in the same manner
as lawyers in private practice and may be tempted to do so to solve a
crime. Accordingly, at a minimum, a suspect or accused has
constitutional protection of the following kind: against governmental
intrusion, including prosecutorial intrusion, into essentials of the
client-lawyer relationship, such as attempts to dissuade a nonclient
from retaining counsel or from trusting or consulting counsel already
retained or assigned; against taking statements from a suspect who is in
custody and has not effectively waived the right to counsel; and against
such measures as unlawful searches of a lawyer’s office or similar
threats to client-lawyer confidentiality. Elaboration of such
limitations is beyond the scope of this Restatement.</h6>

<h6>It has been extensively debated whether, beyond such constitutional
protections, the anti-contact rule independently imposes all constraints
of this Section on prosecutors or, to the contrary, whether the
authorized-by-law exception (see Comment g) entirely removes such
limitations. Both polar positions seem unacceptable. Organizations of
prosecutors and lawyers are elaborating rules governing specific
situations. The scope of such rules and the law in default of such rules
are subjects beyond the scope of this Restatement. Prosecutor contact in
compliance with law is within the authorized-by-law exception stated in
Subsection (1)(c).</h6>

<h6>k. A communication by a client with a represented nonclient. No
general rule prevents a lawyer’s client, either personally or through a
nonlawyer agent, from communicating directly with a represented
nonclient. Thus, while neither a lawyer nor a lawyer’s investigator or
other agent (see Comment b hereto) may contact the represented
nonclient, the same bar does not extend to the client of the lawyer or
the client’s investigator or other agent.</h6>

<h6>The lawyer for a client intending to make such a communication may
advise the client regarding legal aspects of the communication, such as
whether an intended communication is libelous or would otherwise create
risk for the client. Prohibiting such advice would unduly restrict the
client’s autonomy, the client’s interest in obtaining important legal
advice, and the client’s ability to communicate fully with the lawyer.
The lawyer may suggest that the client make such a communication but
must not assist the client inappropriately to seek confidential
information, to invite the nonclient to take action without the advice
of counsel, or otherwise to overreach the nonclient.</h6>

<h6>m. Clarifying, protective, and remedial orders of a tribunal. In
situations of doubt involving communication with a represented
nonclient, a clarifying ruling may be sought from a tribunal. A party
seeking to protect against impermissible contact by an opposing lawyer
may seek a protective or remedial ruling. A ruling may impose conditions
on access and may expand or contract the general rule of this Section as
appropriate in light of circumstances. For example, a ruling permitting
access may require the lawyer to inform each contacted nonclient of the
identity and interests of the lawyer’s client, the right of the
nonclient to refuse to be interviewed, and the right of the nonclient to
request the presence of a lawyer during an interview. The court may
grant access on condition that no statement taken will be admissible in
evidence. Contact pursuant to the terms of such a ruling is authorized
by law within the meaning of this Section (see Comment h).</h6>

<h6>n. Disqualification, evidence suppression, and related remedies.
When contact has been made in violation of this Section, a court may
disqualify the offending lawyer when necessary to protect against a
significant risk of future misuse of confidential information obtained
through the contact, when the contact has substantially interfered with
the client’s relationship with the client’s lawyer, or when
disqualification is appropriate to deter flagrant or reckless
violations. A lawyer violating or threatening to violate the rule may be
enjoined from doing so. A lawyer who violates the rule of this Section
is also subject to professional discipline. Fines and fee-shifting
sanctions may be warranted under applicable procedural law.</h6>

statements, documents, or other material obtained in violation of the
rule. When a release or other document affecting the interests of a
represented nonclient is obtained in violation of the rule, the law
against fraud or overreaching may permit the nonclient to obtain a

<h6>e. An employee or agent whose statement binds an organization under
applicable evidence law (Subsection (2)(c)). Under evidence law
generally applied a century ago and still in force in some jurisdictions
for certain purposes, some employees and agents have the power to make
statements that bind the principal, in the sense that the principal may
not introduce evidence contradicting the binding statement. When such a
binding-admission rule applies, under Subsection (2)(c) an employee or
agent with power to make such a statement is a represented nonclient
within the anti-contact rule of § 99. Such a person is analogous to a
person who possesses power to settle a dispute on behalf of the
organization (see Comment c).</h6>

authority to enter into binding contractual settlements on behalf of the
organization have no power to make such binding statements. Modern
evidence rules make certain statements of an employee or agent
admissible notwithstanding the hearsay rule, but allow the organization
to impeach or contradict such statements. Employees or agents are not

thereto). In certain circumstances, a direction to do so could
constitute an obstruction of justice or a violation of other law.
However, even when lawful, such an instruction is a matter of
intra-organizational policy and not a limitation against a lawyer for
another party who is seeking evidence. Thus, even if an employer, by
general policy or specific directive, lawfully instructs all employees
not to cooperate with another party’s lawyer, that does not enlarge the
scope of the anti-contact rule applicable to that lawyer.</h6>
