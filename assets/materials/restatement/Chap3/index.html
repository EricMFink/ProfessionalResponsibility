<h2>§ 37. Partial or Complete Forfeiture of a Lawyer’s Compensation</h2>
<p>A lawyer engaging in clear and serious violation of duty to a client
may be required to forfeit some or all of the lawyer’s compensation for
the matter. Considerations relevant to the question of forfeiture
include the gravity and timing of the violation, its willfulness, its
effect on the value of the lawyer’s work for the client, any other
threatened or actual harm to the client, and the adequacy of other
remedies.</p>

<h6>a. Scope and cross-references; relation to other doctrines. Even if
a fee is otherwise reasonable (see § 34) and complies with the other
requirements of this Chapter, this Section can in some circumstances
lead to forfeiture. See also § 41, on abusive fee-collection methods,
and § 43, Comments f and g, discussing the discharge of attorney liens.
A client who has already paid a fee subject to forfeiture can sue to
recover it (see §§ 33(1) &amp; 42).</h6>

<h6>A lawyer’s improper conduct can reduce or eliminate the fee that the
lawyer may reasonably charge under § 34 (see Comment c thereof). A
lawyer is not entitled to be paid for services rendered in violation of
the lawyer’s duty to a client or for services needed to alleviate the
consequences of the lawyer’s misconduct. See Restatement Second, Agency
§ 469 (agent entitled to no compensation for conduct which is
disobedient or breach of duty of loyalty to principal). A tribunal will
also consider misconduct more broadly, as evidence of the lawyer’s lack
of competence and loyalty, and hence of the value of the lawyer’s
services.</h6>

<h6>1. Lawyer has been retained at an hourly rate to negotiate a
contract for Client. Lawyer assures the other parties that Client has
consented to a given term, knowing this to be incorrect. Lawyer devotes
five hours to working out the details of the term. When Client insists
that the term be stricken (see § 22), Lawyer devotes four more hours to
explaining to the other parties that Lawyer’s lack of authority and
Client’s rejection of the term requires further negotiations. Lawyer is
not entitled to compensation for any of those nine hours of time under
either § 34 or § 39. The tribunal, moreover, may properly consider the
incident if it bears on the value of such of Lawyer’s other time as is
otherwise reasonably compensable.</h6>

<h6>Second, under contract law a lawyer’s conduct can render
unenforceable the lawyer’s fee contract with a client. Thus under
contract law the misconduct could constitute a material breach of
contract (see § 40) or vitiate the formation of the contract (as in the
case of misrepresentations concerning the lawyer’s credentials).
Alternatively, the contract can be unenforceable because it contains an
unlawful provision (see Restatement Second, Contracts §§ 163, 164, 184,
237, 241, &amp; 374; Restatement Second, Agency § 467). In some cases,
although the contract is unenforceable on its own terms, the lawyer will
still be able to recover the fair value of services rendered (see § 39,
Comment e).</h6>

<h6>Third, a lawyer’s misconduct can constitute malpractice rendering
the lawyer liable for any resulting damage to the client under the
common law or, in some jurisdictions, a consumer-protection statute (see
§ 41, Comment b). Malpractice damages can be greater or smaller than the
forfeited fees. Conduct constituting malpractice is not always the same
as conduct warranting fee forfeiture. A lawyer’s negligent legal
research, for example, might constitute malpractice, but will not
necessarily lead to fee forfeiture. On malpractice liability and
measures of damages generally, see § 53. On the duty of an agent to
recompense a principal for loss caused by the agent’s breach of duty,
see Restatement Second, Agency § 401.</h6>

<h6>b. Rationale. The remedy of fee forfeiture presupposes that a
lawyer’s clear and serious violation of a duty to a client destroys or
severely impairs the client-lawyer relationship and thereby the
justification of the lawyer’s claim to compensation. See Restatement
Second, Trusts § 243 (court has discretion to deny or reduce
compensation of trustee who commits breach of trust); cf. Restatement
Second, Agency § 456(b) (willful and deliberate breach disentitles agent
to recover in quantum meruit when agency contract does not apportion
compensation). Forfeiture is also a deterrent. The damage that
misconduct causes is often difficult to assess. In addition, a tribunal
often can determine a forfeiture sanction more easily than a right to
compensating damages.</h6>

<h6>Forfeiture of fees, however, is not justified in each instance in
which a lawyer violates a legal duty, nor is total forfeiture always
appropriate. Some violations are inadvertent or do not significantly
harm the client. Some can be adequately dealt with by the remedies
described in Comment a or by a partial forfeiture (see Comment e).
Denying the lawyer all compensation would sometimes be an excessive
sanction, giving a windfall to a client. The remedy of this Section
should hence be applied with discretion.</h6>

<h6>c. Violation of a duty to a client. This Section provides for
forfeiture when a lawyer engages in a clear and serious violation (see
Comment d hereto) of a duty to the client. The source of the duty can be
civil or criminal law, including, for example, the requirements of an
applicable lawyer code or the law of malpractice. The misconduct might
have occurred when the lawyer was retained, during the representation,
or during attempts to collect a fee (see § 41). On improper withdrawal
as a ground for forfeiture, see § 40, Comment e.</h6>

<h6>The Section refers only to duties that a lawyer owes to a client,
not to those owed to other persons. That a lawyer, for example, harassed
an opponent in litigation without harming the client does not warrant
relieving the client of any duty to pay the lawyer. On other remedies in
such situations, see § 110. But sometimes harassing a nonclient will
also violate the lawyer’s duty to the client, perhaps exposing the
client to demands for sanctions or making the client’s cause less likely
to prevail. Forfeiture will then be appropriate unless the client is
primarily responsible for the breach of duty to a nonclient.</h6>

<h6>d. A clear and serious violation—relevant factors. A lawyer’s
violation of duty to a client warrants fee forfeiture only if the
lawyer’s violation was clear. A violation is clear if a reasonable
lawyer, knowing the relevant facts and law reasonably accessible to the
lawyer, would have known that the conduct was wrongful. The sanction of
fee forfeiture should not be applied to a lawyer who could not have been
expected to know that conduct was forbidden, for example when the lawyer
followed one reasonable interpretation of a client-lawyer contract and
another interpretation was later held correct.</h6>

<h6>To warrant fee forfeiture a lawyer’s violation must also be serious.
Minor violations do not justify leaving the lawyer entirely unpaid for
valuable services rendered to a client, although some such violations
will reduce the size of the fee or render the lawyer liable to the
client for any harm caused (see Comment a hereto).</h6>

<section id="in-approaching-the-ultimate-issue-of-whether-violation-of-duty-warrants-fee-forfeiture-several-factors-are-relevant.-the-extent-of-the-misconduct-is-one-factor.-normally-forfeiture-is-more-appropriate-for-repeated-or-continuing-violations-than-for-a-single-incident.-whether-the-breach-involved-knowing-violation-or-conscious-disloyalty-to-a-client-is-also-relevant.-see-restatement-second-agency-469-forfeiture-for-willful-and-deliberate-breach.-forfeiture-is-generally-inappropriate-when-the-lawyer-has-not-done-anything-willfully-blameworthy-for-example-when-a-conflict-of-interest-arises-during-a-representation-because-of-the-unexpected-act-of-a-client-or-third-person." class="level6">
<h6>In approaching the ultimate issue of whether violation of duty
warrants fee forfeiture, several factors are relevant. The extent of the
misconduct is one factor. Normally, forfeiture is more appropriate for
repeated or continuing violations than for a single incident. Whether
the breach involved knowing violation or conscious disloyalty to a
client is also relevant. See Restatement Second, Agency § 469
(forfeiture for willful and deliberate breach). Forfeiture is generally
inappropriate when the lawyer has not done anything willfully
blameworthy, for example, when a conflict of interest arises during a
representation because of the unexpected act of a client or third
person.</h6>
</section>
<section id="forfeiture-should-be-proportionate-to-the-seriousness-of-the-offense.-for-example-a-lawyers-failure-to-keep-a-clients-funds-segregated-in-a-separate-account-see-44-should-not-result-in-forfeiture-if-the-funds-are-preserved-undiminished-for-the-client.-but-forfeiture-is-justified-for-a-flagrant-violation-even-though-no-harm-can-be-proved." class="level6">
<h6>Forfeiture should be proportionate to the seriousness of the
offense. For example, a lawyer’s failure to keep a client’s funds
segregated in a separate account (see § 44) should not result in
forfeiture if the funds are preserved undiminished for the client. But
forfeiture is justified for a flagrant violation even though no harm can
be proved.</h6>
</section>
<section id="the-adequacy-of-other-remedies-is-also-relevant.-if-for-example-a-lawyer-improperly-withdraws-from-a-representation-and-is-consequently-limited-to-a-quantum-meruit-recovery-significantly-smaller-than-the-fee-contract-provided-see-40-it-might-be-unnecessary-to-forfeit-the-quantum-meruit-recovery-as-well." class="level6">
<h6>The adequacy of other remedies is also relevant. If, for example, a
lawyer improperly withdraws from a representation and is consequently
limited to a quantum meruit recovery significantly smaller than the fee
contract provided (see § 40), it might be unnecessary to forfeit the
quantum meruit recovery as well.</h6>

<h6>e. Extent of forfeiture. Ordinarily, forfeiture extends to all fees
for the matter for which the lawyer was retained, such as defending a
criminal prosecution or incorporating a corporation. (For a possibly
more limited loss of fees under other rules, see Comment a hereto.) See
§ 42 (client’s suit for refund of fees already paid). Forfeiture does
not extend to a disbursement made by the lawyer to the extent it has

<h6>Sometimes forfeiture for the entire matter is inappropriate, for
example when a lawyer performed valuable services before the misconduct
began, and the misconduct was not so grave as to require forfeiture of
the fee for all services. Ultimately the question is one of fairness in
view of the seriousness of the lawyer’s violation and considering the
special duties imposed on lawyers, the gravity, timing, and likely
consequences to the client of the lawyer’s misbehavior, and the
connection between the various services performed by the lawyer.</h6>

<h6>When a lawyer-employee of a client is discharged for misconduct,
except in an extreme instance this Section does not warrant forfeiture
of all earned salary and pension entitlements otherwise due. The
lawyer’s loss of employment will itself often be a penalty graver than
would be the loss of a fee for a single matter for a nonemployee lawyer.
Employers, moreover, are often in a better position to protect
themselves against misconduct of their lawyer-employees through
supervision and other means. See Comment a hereto; Restatement Second,
Agency § 401. For an employer’s liability for unjust discharge of a
lawyer employee, see § 32, Comment b.</h6>

<h6>b. Measure of compensation when a client discharges a lawyer. A
client might discharge a lawyer before substantial completion of the
services. . Some older decisions reason that such a lawyer, not having
violated the contract, is entitled to receive the contractual fee less
the value of any services the lawyer avoided by being discharged.
Alternatively, it could be argued that the lawyer should be able to
treat the contract as revoked and recover in quantum meruit under § 39
the fair value of whatever services the lawyer rendered, even if that
recovery exceeds the contractual price.</h6>

contractual recovery is appropriate (see Subsection (2)). The discharged
lawyer has not completed the work for which the contractual fee was due.
Noncompletion results not from any improper act of the client, but from
the client’s exercise of the right to discharge counsel (see § 32). That
right should not be encumbered by permitting the lawyer the option of
either recovery at the contractual rate or in quantum meruit without
appropriate adjustment for work yet to be performed.</h6>

requested and Client paid $2,000 in advance, as full payment. After
Lawyer had worked eight hours out of the approximately 16 likely to be
needed, Client discharged Lawyer in order to hire Client’s brother. (a)
If the fair value of Lawyer’s work is $100 per hour, Lawyer is entitled
to $800 for the eight hours actually worked. Lawyer must refund the rest
of the $2,000. (b) If the fair value of Lawyer’s work is $300 per hour,
Lawyer is entitled to that part of the $2,000 applicable to the work
performed, that is to $1,000 and not the fair value of $2,400, because
$1,000 was the contractual price for the work Lawyer performed, which
was approximately half of the work actually contemplated. Lawyer is not
entitled to the full $2,000 lump-sum fee because that fee contemplated
performance of all work involved in Client’s divorce. Accordingly, the
$2,000 must be prorated to reflect the extent of Lawyer’s actual
services.</h6>

<h6>4. Client retained Lawyer to bring a tort suit for a contingent fee
of one-third of any recovery. Client discharged Lawyer after Lawyer had
worked 100 hours, because Client found Lawyer’s manner overbearing. The
fair value of Lawyer’s time is $100 per hour. Until Client prevails in
the suit, Lawyer has no right to a fee, because under the contract no
fee was due unless and until Client recovered (see § 38(3)(d)). If
Client recovers $60,000, Lawyer is entitled to $10,000, which is the
lesser of the contractual fee ($20,000) and the fair value of Lawyer’s
services (100 hours at $100 per hour, or $10,000).</h6>
