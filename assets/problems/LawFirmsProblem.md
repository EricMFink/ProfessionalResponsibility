You are members of a for-profit law firm in Seattle, Washington. The firm’s lawyers practice in a variety of areas, including civil litigation and transactional work. Your firm has 20 partners, 50 associate lawyers, and 30 staff persons. Your firm expects associate lawyers to bill a minimum of 1,800 hours annually to be eligible for the firm’s annual bonus—an important component of associates’ expected income, and a critical marker for anyone seeking partnership within the firm. And, to be considered a truly high-value lawyer, an associate should bill 2,000 hours a year. Over a year, an associate typically can bill about two hours of time for every three hours of work actually performed. Your associates receive two weeks of annual vacation time. The partners all draw a base salary, and further share in the annual profits. Your staff receive a salary with benefits, including one or two weeks of vacation time, depending on seniority.

Your firm has no pro bono policy. Firm partners, however, have been pressured recently by the State Bar, your associate lawyers, and even clients to adopt and follow a pro bono policy. Your law office group is the partnership executive committee for your firm, tasked with deciding on a firm pro bono policy. Prepare a memo no longer than two pages proposing a pro bono policy. Your policy should not be simply an abstract policy statement about pro bono work. Rather, identify whether pro bono work will be expected, discretionary but supported, or not supported. Explain the rationale for this decision to the members of your practice. If the firm requires or supports pro bono work, how—meaning from who’s wallet—will the firm subsidize this work?
