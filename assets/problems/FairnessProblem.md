You are a family law practitioner in Spokane, Washington. Your client is embroiled in a contested divorce proceeding against your client’s spouse. The case involves numerous obstacles to a negotiated disposition, such as the division of real property and other valuable assets, child custody and support, and pets. At the first two court appearances, your client’s spouse appeared pro se, and you dealt directly with the spouse as an unrepresented person. At the next appearance, however, you noticed the spouse working with someone in the hallway, although this person did not appear for the spouse in court. You asked the court clerk who the person was, and the clerk said, “Oh, he hired one of those limited license legal technicians.”

Now that you know your client’s spouse is represented by a legal technician, how may, or must, you communicate with the opposing party? Hint: You will need to visit the Washington Supreme Court’s website to review recently adopted amendments to Title 4 of the Rules of Professional Conduct.
