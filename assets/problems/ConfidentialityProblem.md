Your law practice provides professional responsibility advice and representation to other lawyers. Lawyer retained you for advice. Lawyer supplied these facts:

Lawyer represented Client in a contested divorce case. Lawyer and Client agreed to limited scope representation, where Lawyer would assist Client with paperwork and documentation to prepare the case, but would not appear in court on Client’s behalf. Lawyer and Client agreed that Client would remain pro se in court, including on all issues relating to discovery.1 One day while in family court on another matter, Lawyer encountered Client who was attending court on his case. After a brief conversation, Client said to Lawyer, “This judge is treating me really unfairly. I am not following the judge’s orders on discovery. I want to give this judge a hard time, and I don’t want my ex-spouse to know about all my assets. You of course won’t say anything as my lawyer. Don’t worry, your name is not on anything relating to discovery, as we agreed.”

Lawyer advised you that she wants to disclose Client’s discovery violations to counsel for the ex-spouse, both to protect the ex-spouse’s legitimate interests and to alert the judge. Lawyer presented these questions to your firm: (1) Did Client’s statement to Lawyer about his discovery misconduct constitute confidential information protected by Model Rule 1.6(a)?; (2) If this information was confidential, would Model Rule 1.6(b) permit disclosure of this information to counsel for the ex-spouse?2; and (3) What course of action do you recommend to Lawyer about whether to disclose this information?
