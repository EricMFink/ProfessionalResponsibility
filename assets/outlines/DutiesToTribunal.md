# Candor to the Tribunal

## False representations or evidence & duty to remedy 

**Rule 3.3(a), (b) & (c)**

*Nix v. Whiteside* (US 1986) 

- Ineffective assistance of counsel claim rejected 
- Court reiterates *Strickland* standard
    - Lawyer's conduct fell below standard of reasonableness
    - Client suffered prejudice (i.e. outcome of case was less favorable) as a result
- Lawyer warned client that if client gave false testimony lawyer would have to disclose that to the court and would seek to withdraw if client insisted on doing so
- Client testified truthfully

*U.S. v. Long* (8th Cir. 1988) 

- Conviction affirmed, without prejudice to defendant's ability to assert ineffective assistance claim in collateral proceeding
- Prior to client's testimony at trial, lawyer told judge he believed client might commit perjury
- Client then declined to testify
- Court says evidentiary hearing is needed to determine whether attorney's conduct fell below *Strickland* standard of competence

## Candor in Ex Parte Proceedings

**Rule 3.3(d)**

Attorney must disclose all relevant facts, including those adverse to client 

# Impartiality & Decorum 

**Rule 3.5**

## Ex Parte Communications 

**Rule 3.5(b)** 

- Prohibition is not limited to communication about the case, but covers all communication about any subject 
    - In practice, limited social communication (e.g. exchange of greetings) may not result in discipline absent circumstances suggesting prejudice 
    - But the best practice is for lawyers to avoid all communication with judges and jurors while case is pending 
    - Judicial ethics rules likewise prohibit *ex parte* communication by judge with parties, attorneys, and others
        - Even if judge initiates communication with lawyer, lawyer should refrain from engaging in communication 

## Trial Publicity

**Rule 3.6**

*Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada* (US 1991) 

- Attorney disciplined for public statement about pending criminal case
- Discipline violated first amendment, where statements expressed political opinion and were unlikely to prejudice client's right to fair trial

## Lawyer as Witness

**Rule 3.7**

## Special Responsibilities of Prosecutors

**Rule 3.8**

# Advocate in Non-Adjudicative Proceedings

**Rule 3.9**
