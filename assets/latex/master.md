## Professional Gatekeeping 

### Misconduct & Discipline 

#### Neal v. Clinton, No. CIV 2000â€“5677 (Ark. Cir. Ct. Jan. 19, 2001)

_Agreed Order of Discipline_

Come now the parties hereto and agree to the following Order of this Court in settlement of the pending action:

The formal charges of misconduct upon which this Order is based arose out of information referred to the Committee on Professional Conduct ("the Committee") by the Honorable Susan Webber Wright, Chief United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas. The information pertained to William Jefferson Clinton's deposition testimony in a civil case brought by Ms. Paula Jones in which he was a defendant, _Jones v. Clinton_.
