# Description

In this course, you will learn about the procedures for civil suits. You will also learn how to understand and use primary legal texts (constitutions, statutes, rules, & judicial opinions) as tools for analyzing legal problems. While the course will focus on federal courts, the rules of civil procedure in many states (including North Carolina) are similar. 

Topics to be covered include the selection of an appropriate forum, the scope of a lawsuit, the presentation of claims and defenses, disposition without a trial, the choice of applicable law, and the effect of judgments on future litigation. Other aspects of civil litigation (e.g., discovery, trials, & appeals) are covered in upper-level elective courses. 

# Policies 

#### Grading

Your final grade for the term will be based on four quizzes (5% each; 20% total), a final exam (70%), and in-class performance (10%). 

The quizzes will consist of multiple choice questions. These will be given in class and will be open-book/open-notes. Dates for the quizzes will be announced at least one week in advance. 

The final exam will consist of essay and short-answer questions. It will be given during the final exam period and will be closed-book/closed-notes. 

The in-class performance component depends on your preparation before class (completing all assigned reading and reviewing simulation problems), regular and prompt class attendance, and constructive engagement during class. Elon Law School's standards and ABA guidance for awarding course credit assume at least two hours of out-of-class student work for each hour of classroom instruction.

#### Attendance 

Elon Law School has adopted the following attendance policy for all courses: 

> The Law School administers a policy that a student maintain regular and punctual class attendance in all courses in which the student is registered, including externships, clinical courses, or simulation courses. Faculty members will give students written notice of their attendance policies before or during the first week of class. These policies may include, but are not limited to: treating late arrivals, early departures, and/or lack of preparation as absences; imposing grade or point reductions for absences, including assigning a failing grade or involuntarily withdrawing a student from the class; and any other policies that a professor deems appropriate to create a rigorous and professional classroom environment.
>
> In case of illness or emergency, students may contact the Office of Student and Professional Life, which will then notify the student’s instructors. A student may notify the faculty member directly of a planned absence and should refer to individual faculty members regarding any policy that may apply. In the case of prolonged illness or incapacity, the student should contact the Office of Student and Professional Life.

Excessive absences (more than 2 classes) may result in a reduction of your grade.

#### Disability Accommodations 

For disability accommodation requests, contact the Law School [Registrar's Office](https://www.elon.edu/e/law/academics/registrar-office/index.html). 

#### Honor Code 

The Law School [honor code](https://www.elon.edu/e/law/student-experience/honor-code.html) applies to all activities related to your law school study, including conduct during class and examinations.
