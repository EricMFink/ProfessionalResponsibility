<h4>Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U.S. 157 (1986)</h4>
<p class="case-h1">
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER delivered the opinion of the Court.
</p>
<p>We granted certiorari to decide whether the Sixth Amendment right of
a criminal defendant to assistance of counsel is violated when an
attorney refuses to cooperate with the defendant in presenting perjured
testimony at his trial.</p>
<p>Whiteside was convicted of second-degree murder by a jury verdict
which was affirmed by the Iowa courts. The killing took place on
February 8, 1977, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Whiteside and two others went
to one Calvin Love’s apartment late that night, seeking marihuana. Love
was in bed when Whiteside and his companions arrived; an argument
between Whiteside and Love over the marihuana ensued. At one point, Love
directed his girlfriend to get his “piece,” and at another point got up,
then returned to his bed. According to Whiteside’s testimony, Love then
started to reach under his pillow and moved toward Whiteside. Whiteside
stabbed Love in the chest, inflicting a fatal wound.</p>
<p>Whiteside was charged with murder, and when counsel was appointed he
objected to the lawyer initially appointed, claiming that he felt
uncomfortable with a lawyer who had formerly been a prosecutor. Gary L.
Robinson was then appointed and immediately began an investigation.
Whiteside gave him a statement that he had stabbed Love as the latter
“was pulling a pistol from underneath the pillow on the bed.” Upon
questioning by Robinson, however, Whiteside indicated that he had not
actually seen a gun, but that he was convinced that Love had a gun. No
pistol was found on the premises; shortly after the police search
following the stabbing, which had revealed no weapon, the victim’s
family had removed all of the victim’s possessions from the apartment.
Robinson interviewed Whiteside’s companions who were present during the
stabbing, and none had seen a gun during the incident. Robinson advised
Whiteside that the existence of a gun was not necessary to establish the
claim of self-defense, and that only a reasonable belief that the victim
had a gun nearby was necessary even though no gun was actually
present.</p>
<p>Until shortly before trial, Whiteside consistently stated to Robinson
that he had not actually seen a gun, but that he was convinced that Love
had a gun in his hand. About a week before trial, during preparation for
direct examination, Whiteside for the first time told Robinson and his
associate Donna Paulsen that he had seen something “metallic” in Love’s
hand. When asked about this, Whiteside responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Howard Cook’s case there was a gun. If I don’t say I saw a gun,
I’m dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Robinson told Whiteside that such testimony would be perjury and
repeated that it was not necessary to prove that a gun was available but
only that Whiteside reasonably believed that he was in danger. On
Whiteside’s insisting that he would testify that he saw “something
metallic” Robinson told him, according to Robinson’s testimony:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We could not allow him to testify falsely because that would be
perjury, and as officers of the court we would be suborning perjury if
we allowed him to do it. I advised him that if he did do that it would
be my duty to advise the Court of what he was doing and that I felt he
was committing perjury; also, that I probably would be allowed to
attempt to impeach that particular testimony.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Robinson also indicated he would seek to withdraw from the
representation if Whiteside insisted on committing perjury.</p>
<p>Whiteside testified in his own defense at trial and stated that he
“knew” that Love had a gun and that he believed Love was reaching for a
gun and he had acted swiftly in self-defense. On cross-examination, he
admitted that he had not actually seen a gun in Love’s hand. Robinson
presented evidence that Love had been seen with a sawed-off shotgun on
other occasions, that the police search of the apartment may have been
careless, and that the victim’s family had removed everything from the
apartment shortly after the crime. Robinson presented this evidence to
show a basis for Whiteside’s asserted fear that Love had a gun.</p>
<p>The jury returned a verdict of second-degree murder, and Whiteside
moved for a new trial, claiming that he had been deprived of a fair
trial by Robinson’s admonitions not to state that he saw a gun or
“something metallic.” The trial court held a hearing, heard testimony by
Whiteside and Robinson, and denied the motion. The trial court made
specific findings that the facts were as related by Robinson.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of Iowa affirmed respondent’s conviction. That
court held that the right to have counsel present all appropriate
defenses does not extend to using perjury, and that an attorney’s duty
to a client does not extend to assisting a client in committing perjury.
Relying on the Iowa Code of Professional Responsibility for Lawyers,
which expressly prohibits an attorney from using perjured testimony, and
the Iowa Code, which criminalizes subornation of perjury, the Iowa court
concluded that not only were Robinson’s actions permissible, but were
required. The court commended “both Mr. Robinson and Ms. Paulsen for the
high ethical manner in which this matter was handled.”</p>
<p>Whiteside then petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. In that
petition Whiteside alleged that he had been denied effective assistance
of counsel and of his right to present a defense by Robinson’s refusal
to allow him to testify as he had proposed. The District Court denied
the writ. Accepting the state trial court’s factual finding that
Whiteside’s intended testimony would have been perjurious, it concluded
that there could be no grounds for habeas relief since there is no
constitutional right to present a perjured defense.</p>
<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed
and directed that the writ of habeas corpus be granted. The Court of
Appeals accepted the findings of the trial judge, affirmed by the Iowa
Supreme Court, that trial counsel believed with good cause that
Whiteside would testify falsely and acknowledged that under <em>Harris
v. New York</em>, a criminal defendant’s privilege to testify in his own
behalf does not include a right to commit perjury. Nevertheless, the
court reasoned that an intent to commit perjury, communicated to
counsel, does not alter a defendant’s right to effective assistance of
counsel and that Robinson’s admonition to Whiteside that he would inform
the court of Whiteside’s perjury constituted a threat to violate the
attorney’s duty to preserve client confidences. According to the Court
of Appeals, this threatened violation of client confidences breached the
standards of effective representation set down in <em>Strickland v.
Washington</em>. The court also concluded that <em>Strickland</em>’s
prejudice requirement was satisfied by an implication of prejudice from
the conflict between Robinson’s duty of loyalty to his client and his
ethical duties. A petition for rehearing en banc was denied. We granted
certiorari and we reverse.</p>
<p class="case-h2">
A
</p>
<p>The right of an accused to testify in his defense is of relatively
recent origin. Until the latter part of the preceding century, criminal
defendants in this country, as at common law, were considered to be
disqualified from giving sworn testimony at their own trial by reason of
their interest as a party to the case. Iowa was among the states that
adhered to this rule of disqualification.</p>
<p>By the end of the 19th century, however, the disqualification was
finally abolished by statute in most states and in the federal courts.
Although this Court has never explicitly held that a criminal defendant
has a due process right to testify in his own behalf, cases in several
Circuits have so held, and the right has long been assumed. We have also
suggested that such a right exists as a corollary to the Fifth Amendment
privilege against compelled testimony.</p>
<p class="case-h2">
B
</p>
<p>We turn next to the question presented: the definition of the range
of “reasonable professional” responses to a criminal defendant client
who informs counsel that he will perjure himself on the stand. We must
determine whether, in this setting, Robinson’s conduct fell within the
wide range of professional responses to threatened client perjury
acceptable under the Sixth Amendment.</p>
<p>In <em>Strickland</em>, we recognized counsel’s duty of loyalty and
his “overarching duty to advocate the defendant’s cause.” Plainly, that
duty is limited to legitimate, lawful conduct compatible with the very
nature of a trial as a search for truth. Although counsel must take all
reasonable lawful means to attain the objectives of the client, counsel
is precluded from taking steps or in any way assisting the client in
presenting false evidence or otherwise violating the law. This principle
has consistently been recognized in most unequivocal terms by expositors
of the norms of professional conduct since the first Canons of
Professional Ethics were adopted by the American Bar Association in
1908. The 1908 Canon 32 provided:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No client, corporate or individual, however powerful, nor any cause,
civil or political, however important, is entitled to receive nor should
any lawyer render any service or advice involving disloyalty to the law
whose ministers we are, or disrespect of the judicial office, which we
are bound to uphold, or corruption of any person or persons exercising a
public office or private trust, or deception or betrayal of the public.
He must observe and advise his client to observe the statute law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, this Canon did no more than articulate centuries of
accepted standards of conduct. Similarly, Canon 37, adopted in 1928,
explicitly acknowledges as an exception to the attorney’s duty of
confidentiality a client’s announced intention to commit a crime:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The announced intention of a client to commit a crime is not included
within the confidences which the attorney is bound to respect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These principles have been carried through to contemporary
codifications of an attorney’s professional responsibility. Disciplinary
Rule 7-102 of the Model Code of Professional Responsibility (1980),
entitled “Representing a Client Within the Bounds of the Law,”
provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol type="A">
<li>In his representation of a client, a lawyer shall not: (4) Knowingly
use perjured testimony or false evidence. (7) Counsel or assist his
client in conduct that the lawyer knows to be illegal or
fraudulent.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This provision has been adopted by Iowa, and is binding on all
lawyers who appear in its courts.</p>
<p>The more recent Model Rules of Professional Conduct (1983) similarly
admonish attorneys to obey all laws in the course of representing a
client:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>RULE 1.2 Scope of Representation (d) A lawyer shall not counsel a
client to engage, or assist a client, in conduct that the lawyer knows
is criminal or fraudulent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both the Model Code of Professional Responsibility and the Model
Rules of Professional Conduct also adopt the specific exception from the
attorney-client privilege for disclosure of perjury that his client
intends to commit or has committed. Indeed, both the Model Code and the
Model Rules do not merely authorize disclosure by counsel of client
perjury; they require such disclosure.</p>
<p>These standards confirm that the legal profession has accepted that
an attorney’s ethical duty to advance the interests of his client is
limited by an equally solemn duty to comply with the law and standards
of professional conduct; it specifically ensures that the client may not
use false evidence. This special duty of an attorney to prevent and
disclose frauds upon the court derives from the recognition that perjury
is as much a crime as tampering with witnesses or jurors by way of
promises and threats, and undermines the administration of justice. The
offense of perjury was a crime recognized at common law, and has been
made a felony in most states by statute, including Iowa. An attorney who
aids false testimony by questioning a witness when perjurious responses
can be anticipated risks prosecution for subornation of perjury.</p>
<p>It is universally agreed that at a minimum the attorney’s first duty
when confronted with a proposal for perjurious testimony is to attempt
to dissuade the client from the unlawful course of conduct. Withdrawal
of counsel when this situation arises at trial gives rise to many
difficult questions including possible mistrial and claims of double
jeopardy.</p>
<p>The essence of the brief amicus of the American Bar Association
reviewing practices long accepted by ethical lawyers is that under no
circumstance may a lawyer either advocate or passively tolerate a
client’s giving false testimony. This, of course, is consistent with the
governance of trial conduct in what we have long called “a search for
truth.” The suggestion sometimes made that “a lawyer must believe his
client, not judge him” in no sense means a lawyer can honorably be a
party to or in any way give aid to presenting known perjury.</p>
<p>Considering Robinson’s representation of respondent in light of these
accepted norms of professional conduct, we discern no failure to adhere
to reasonable professional standards that would in any sense make out a
deprivation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Whether Robinson’s
conduct is seen as a successful attempt to dissuade his client from
committing the crime of perjury, or whether seen as a “threat” to
withdraw from representation and disclose the illegal scheme, Robinson’s
representation of Whiteside falls well within accepted standards of
professional conduct and the range of reasonable professional conduct
acceptable under <em>Strickland</em>.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals assumed for the purpose of the decision that
Whiteside would have given false testimony had counsel not intervened;
its opinion denying a rehearing en banc states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We presume that appellant would have testified falsely. Counsel’s
actions prevented Whiteside from testifying falsely. We hold that
counsel’s action deprived appellant of due process and effective
assistance of counsel. Counsel’s actions also impermissibly compromised
appellant’s right to testify in his own defense by conditioning
continued representation by counsel and confidentiality upon appellant’s
restricted testimony.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While purporting to follow Iowa’s highest court “on all questions of
state law,” the Court of Appeals reached its conclusions on the basis of
federal constitutional due process and right to counsel.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals’ holding that Robinson’s “action deprived
Whiteside of due process and effective assistance of counsel” is not
supported by the record since Robinson’s action, at most, deprived
Whiteside of his contemplated perjury. Nothing counsel did in any way
undermined Whiteside’s claim that he believed the victim was reaching
for a gun. Similarly, the record gives no support for holding that
Robinson’s action “also impermissibly compromised Whiteside’s right to
testify in his own defense by conditioning continued representation and
confidentiality upon Whiteside’s restricted testimony.” The record in
fact shows the contrary: (a) that Whiteside did testify, and (b) he was
“restricted” or restrained only from testifying falsely and was aided by
Robinson in developing the basis for the fear that Love was reaching for
a gun. Robinson divulged no client communications until he was compelled
to do so in response to Whiteside’s post-trial challenge to the quality
of his performance. We see this as a case in which the attorney
successfully dissuaded the client from committing the crime of
perjury.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, even while accepting the conclusion of the Iowa trial
court that Whiteside’s proposed testimony would have been a criminal
act, the Court of Appeals held that Robinson’s efforts to persuade
Whiteside not to commit that crime were improper, first, as forcing an
impermissible choice between the right to counsel and the right to
testify; and, second, as compromising client confidences because of
Robinson’s threat to disclose the contemplated perjury. Whatever the
scope of a constitutional right to testify, it is elementary that such a
right does not extend to testifying falsely. In <em>Harris v. New
York</em>, we assumed the right of an accused to testify “in his own
defense, or to refuse to do so” and went on to hold:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That privilege cannot be construed to include the right to commit
perjury. Having voluntarily taken the stand, petitioner was under an
obligation to speak truthfully.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <em>Harris</em> we held the defendant could be impeached by prior
contrary statements which had been ruled inadmissible under <em>Miranda
v. Arizona</em>. <em>Harris</em> and other cases make it crystal clear
that there is no right whatever – constitutional or otherwise – for a
defendant to use false evidence.</p>
<p>The paucity of authority on the subject of any such “right” may be
explained by the fact that such a notion has never been responsibly
advanced; the right to counsel includes no right to have a lawyer who
will cooperate with planned perjury. A lawyer who would so cooperate
would be at risk of prosecution for suborning perjury, and disciplinary
proceedings, including suspension or disbarment.</p>
<p>Robinson’s admonitions to his client can in no sense be said to have
forced respondent into an impermissible choice between his right to
counsel and his right to testify as he proposed for there was no
permissible choice to testify falsely. For defense counsel to take steps
to persuade a criminal defendant to testify truthfully, or to withdraw,
deprives the defendant of neither his right to counsel nor the right to
testify truthfully. In <em>United States v. Havens</em>, we made clear
that “when defendants testify, they must testify truthfully or suffer
the consequences.” When an accused proposes to resort to perjury or to
produce false evidence, one consequence is the risk of withdrawal of
counsel.</p>
<p>On this record, the accused enjoyed continued representation within
the bounds of reasonable professional conduct and did in fact exercise
his right to testify; at most he was denied the right to have the
assistance of counsel in the presentation of false testimony. Similarly,
we can discern no breach of professional duty in Robinson’s admonition
to respondent that he would disclose respondent’s perjury to the court.
The crime of perjury in this setting is indistinguishable in substance
from the crime of threatening or tampering with a witness or a juror. A
defendant who informed his counsel that he was arranging to bribe or
threaten witnesses or members of the jury would have no “right” to
insist on counsel’s assistance or silence. Counsel would not be limited
to advising against that conduct. An attorney’s duty of confidentiality,
which totally covers the client’s admission of guilt, does not extend to
a client’s announced plans to engage in future criminal conduct. In
short, the responsibility of an ethical lawyer, as an officer of the
court and a key component of a system of justice, dedicated to a search
for truth, is essentially the same whether the client announces an
intention to bribe or threaten witnesses or jurors or to commit or
procure perjury. No system of justice worthy of the name can tolerate a
lesser standard.</p>
<p>The rule adopted by the Court of Appeals, which seemingly would
require an attorney to remain silent while his client committed perjury,
is wholly incompatible with the established standards of ethical conduct
and the laws of Iowa and contrary to professional standards promulgated
by that State. The position advocated by petitioner, on the contrary, is
wholly consistent with the Iowa standards of professional conduct and
law, with the overwhelming majority of courts, and with codes of
professional ethics. Since there has been no breach of any recognized
professional duty, it follows that there can be no deprivation of the
right to assistance of counsel under the Strickland standard.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
Conclusion
</p>
<p>Whiteside’s attorney treated Whiteside’s proposed perjury in accord
with professional standards, and since Whiteside’s truthful testimony
could not have prejudiced the result of his trial, the Court of Appeals
was in error to direct the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus and must
be reversed.</p>

<h4>People v. DePallo, 754 N.E.2d 751 (NY 2001)</h4>
<p class="case-h1">
Wesley, J.
</p>
<p>This case calls upon us to clarify a defense attorney’s
responsibilities when confronted with the dilemma that a client intends
to commit perjury.</p>
<p>Defendant and his accomplices executed a calculated attack on a
71-year-old man, ransacking his home, stabbing him repeatedly with a
knife and scissors, and finally bludgeoning him to death with a shovel.
Defendant’s blood was found at the scene and on the victim’s clothing.
Defendant’s fingerprint was also discovered in the home and, upon
arrest, he made several incriminating statements placing him at the
scene of the crime. Defendant also insisted on making a statement during
pre-trial proceedings in which he admitted that he had forced one of his
accomplices to participate in the crime under threat of death.</p>
<p>At trial, defense counsel noted at a sidebar that he had advised
defendant that he did not have to testify and should not testify, but if
he did, he should do so truthfully. Defendant confirmed counsel’s
statements to the court but insisted on testifying. Defense counsel
elicited defendant’s direct testimony in narrative form. Defendant
testified that he was home the entire evening of the crime, and that his
contrary statements to the police were induced by promises that he could
return home. During the prosecutor’s cross-examination, defense counsel
made numerous objections.</p>
<p>After both sides rested, defense counsel addressed the court in
Chambers, outside the presence of defendant and the prosecutor. Counsel
stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>prior to the [defendant’s] testimony, I informed the Court that * * *
the defendant was going to take the witness stand, and that he had
previously told me he was involved in this homicide. Although I did not
get into details with him, I don’t know exactly what his involvement
was, but he had stated to me that he was there that night, he had gotten
at least that far.</p>
<p>Knowing that, I told the defendant I cannot participate in any kind
of perjury, and you really shouldn’t perjure yourself. But, he, you
know, dealing with him is kind of difficult and he was insistent upon
taking the stand. He never told me what he was going to say, but I knew
it was not going to be the truth, at least to the extent of him denying
participation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The court then noted that counsel had complied with the procedures
for such circumstances [ … ]. During summations, defense counsel did not
refer to defendant’s trial testimony. Defendant was convicted of two
counts of second degree murder (intentional and felony murder based on
the burglary), two counts of first degree robbery, two counts of first
degree burglary, and one count of second degree robbery. The Appellate
Division affirmed, rejecting defendant’s claims that he was denied
effective assistance of counsel when his attorney disclosed the perjured
testimony to the court and that the ex parte conference was a material
stage of trial. A Judge of this Court granted leave to appeal, and we
now affirm.</p>
<p>The ethical dilemma presented by this case is not new. Defense
attorneys have confronted the problem of client perjury since the latter
part of the 19th century when the disqualification of criminal
defendants to testify in their own defense was abolished by statute in
federal courts and in most states, including New York in 1869. A lawyer
with a perjurious client must contend with competing
considerations—duties of zealous advocacy, confidentiality and loyalty
to the client on the one hand, and a responsibility to the courts and
our truth-seeking system of justice on the other. Courts, bar
associations and commentators have struggled to define the most
appropriate role for counsel caught in such situations.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these ethical concerns, a defendant’s right to
testify at trial does not include a right to commit perjury, and the
Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel does not compel
counsel to assist or participate in the presentation of perjured
testimony. In light of these limitations, an attorney’s duty to
zealously represent a client is circumscribed by an “equally solemn duty
to comply with the law and standards of professional conduct * * * to
prevent and disclose frauds upon the court”. The United States Supreme
Court has noted that counsel must first attempt to persuade the client
not to pursue the unlawful course of conduct. If unsuccessful,
withdrawal from representation may be an appropriate response, but when
confronted with the problem during trial, as here, an “attorney’s
revelation of his client’s perjury to the court is a professionally
responsible and acceptable response”.</p>
<p>This approach is consistent with the ethical obligations of attorneys
under New York’s Code of Professional Responsibility. DR 7-102 expressly
prohibits an attorney, under penalty of sanctions, from knowingly using
perjured testimony or false evidence; knowingly making a false statement
of fact; participating in the creation or preservation of evidence when
the attorney knows, or it is obvious, that the evidence is false;
counseling or assisting the client in conduct the lawyer knows to be
illegal or fraudulent; and knowingly engaging in other illegal conduct.
Additionally, DR 7-102 (b) (1) mandates that “a lawyer who receives
information clearly establishing that * * * the client has, in the
course of the representation, perpetrated a fraud upon a * * * tribunal
shall promptly call upon the client to rectify the same, and if the
client refuses or is unable to do so, <em>the lawyer shall reveal the
fraud to the affected * * * tribunal,</em> except when the information
is protected as a confidence or secret”.</p>
<p>In accordance with these responsibilities, defense counsel first
sought to dissuade defendant from testifying falsely, and indeed from
testifying at all. Defendant insisted on proceeding to give the perjured
testimony and, thereafter, counsel properly notified the court.</p>
<p>The intent to commit a crime is not a protected confidence or secret.
Moreover, in this case defense counsel did not reveal the substance of
any client confidence as defendant had already admitted at a pre-trial
hearing that he had forced one of his accomplices to participate in the
crime under threat of death.</p>
<p>Finally, defendant contends that his counsel should have sought to
withdraw from the case. However, substitution of counsel would do little
to resolve the problem and might, in fact, have facilitated any fraud
defendant wished to perpetrate upon the court. Withdrawal of counsel
could present other unsatisfactory scenarios which ultimately could lead
to introduction of the perjured testimony in any event or further delay
the proceedings.</p>
<p>In this case, defendant was allowed to present his testimony in
narrative form to the jury. The remainder of defense counsel’s
representation throughout the trial was more than competent. The
lawyer’s actions properly balanced the duties he owed to his client and
to the court and criminal justice system; “since there has been no
breach of any recognized professional duty, it follows that there can be
no deprivation of the right to assistance of counsel”.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be
affirmed.</p>

<h4>State v. Hischke, 639 N.W.2d 6 (Iowa 2002)</h4>
<p class="case-h1">
Streit, J.
</p>
<p>Mark Hischke made an eleventh-hour decision to deny possession of
marijuana after previously admitting to the police and his lawyer the
marijuana belonged to him. Hischke’s trial counsel, John Bishop,
informed the court Hischke intended to commit perjury. After a jury
trial, the court convicted Hischke of possession of marijuana. Hischke
appeals contending he was denied effective assistance of counsel when
his trial lawyer alerted the court to his “personal belief” Hischke
planned to present perjured testimony. Because we find Bishop had good
cause to believe Hischke’s proposed testimony would be deliberately
untruthful, we affirm.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
I. Facts
</p>
<p>On December 5, 1999, Waterloo police officers executed an arrest
warrant on Eric Twesme at his apartment. When the officers arrived,
Twesme and Mark Hischke were present in the apartment. Twesme answered
the door and permitted the officers to enter. In the apartment, the
officers saw syringes, spoons, and cotton. The officers asked Hischke to
wait in the hallway where he consented to a search of his person. The
officer discovered a syringe in Hischke’s shirt pocket. Before going to
the police station, Twesme asked the officers for a jacket. One of the
officers saw a leather jacket in the apartment draped over the back of
the chair where Hischke had been sitting. The officer asked Twesme if
the jacket was his and Twesme said it did not belong to him. Hischke
admitted ownership of the jacket but said he was not responsible for
anything in the pockets. During a consent search, the police officer
found a small bag of marijuana in the jacket.</p>
<p>Mark Hischke was charged with possession of marijuana. On the day the
trial was scheduled to begin, Hischke’s attorney, John Bishop, moved to
withdraw from the case. Bishop stated his client initially claimed
ownership of the marijuana but shortly before the trial Hischke denied
ownership. Bishop explained to the court,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s my personal belief that Mr. Hischke’s original statements to me
that the marijuana was his was the truth, and if Mr. Hischke requires me
to present evidence otherwise I think I would be presenting perjured
testimony, and so I don’t feel I can ethically be permitted to do that.
But Mr. Hischke wishes to present that defense and that’s, I guess, the
dilemma we have here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The district court informed Hischke he would not be permitted to
testify as to the ownership of the marijuana. Hischke declined to
testify and the jury found him guilty as charged.</p>
<p>On appeal, Hischke contends he was denied effective assistance of
counsel when Bishop informed the court he believed his client was going
to present perjured testimony. Hischke argues it is not sufficient for
an attorney to merely “believe” a client intends to commit perjury.
Hischke asks us to adopt a standard that requires an attorney to have
“actual knowledge” the client’s testimony will be false. Hischke argues
prejudice should be presumed.</p>
<p>The State contends an attorney need only have a “firm factual basis”
for believing a client plans to lie before taking any measures designed
to prevent such perjury. The State argues Bishop satisfied this
standard.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
III. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel
</p>
<p>To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, Hischke
must demonstrate both ineffective assistance and prejudice. Both
elements must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. If a claim
lacks one of the elements of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim,
it is not necessary for us to address the other element.</p>
<p>Hischke must first prove Bishop’s performance was not within the
normal range of competence. We measure the attorney’s performance by
standards of reasonableness consistent with “prevailing professional
norms.” We begin our analysis with the presumption Bishop performed
competently. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are more likely
to be found where counsel lacked diligence as opposed to the exercise of
judgment.</p>
<p>Bishop believed his client planned on committing perjury. Trial
counsel may not knowingly present perjured testimony. When counsel knows
a client has committed perjury or plans on doing so, counsel may reveal
the perjury to the court. On this appeal, we must determine whether
Bishop performed competently and reasonably in deciding to inform the
court his client intended to present perjured testimony.</p>
<p>The central issue before us is what standard of knowledge is required
before a lawyer may inform the court of his or her client’s plan to
commit perjury. There are several factors to consider in making this
determination: (1) how certain counsel was the proposed testimony was
false; (2) at what stage of the proceedings counsel discovered the plan;
and (3) the ways in which the attorney may be able to dissuade his or
her client from committing perjury.</p>
<p>Other jurisdictions have addressed the standard to be applied when a
lawyer informs the court his or her client intends to commit perjury.
Some courts require a lawyer to have knowledge “beyond a reasonable
doubt” before disclosing to the court the belief a client is planning on
committing perjury. Other courts have adopted the “firm factual basis”
standard. Another court requires a “good faith determination” by counsel
the defendant will commit perjury when he testifies. Certain other
courts require counsel to engage in an independent investigation of the
facts before determining the defendant’s anticipated testimony will
constitute perjury.</p>
<p>We have not addressed this particular issue in Iowa since 1978. At
that time, we addressed this issue within the context of a case with
factual circumstances very similar to the case before us. In
<em>Whiteside</em>, the lawyer relied on the defendant’s pronouncement
shortly before trial that was inconsistent with his story during the
initial phases of the proceedings. In asserting self-defense the
defendant initially claimed he “thought” the victim had a gun but he did
not actually see the gun. Then, before trial, the defendant told counsel
he intended to testify he did see a gun because without such testimony
he was “dead.” We concluded a lawyer is required to be convinced with
good cause to believe the defendant’s proposed testimony would be
deliberately untruthful. Moreover, the lawyer was not required to
conduct an independent investigation of the facts before determining his
client planned to commit perjury. We reaffirm our holding in
<em>Whiteside</em>.</p>
<p>We now turn to the facts before us to determine whether Hischke was
denied effective assistance when Bishop alerted the court to Hischke’s
plan to testify falsely. These are the relevant facts as they occurred
before Hischke’s change in story. Immediately before Hischke’s arrest,
he told the police officers he owned the leather jacket but was not
responsible for anything inside the pockets. This statement indicates
Hischke was aware the officers would find something illegal in the
jacket. Consistent with Hischke’s declaration of ownership, Twesme told
the police officers the leather jacket did not belong to him. Hischke
then wore the leather jacket to the police station. During his initial
contact with Bishop, Hischke stated the jacket belonged to him.</p>
<p>Shortly before the trial was scheduled to begin, Hischke learned of
the enhanced sentence that would accompany his third conviction on a
charge of possession of marijuana. At this time Hischke changed his
testimony and told Bishop the jacket did not belong to him. Hischke
claims he had only been taking “the rap” for his friend Twesme but would
no longer do so because of the enhanced punishment Hischke faced. This
statement is questionable because of its lateness.</p>
<p>In addition to the facts above, other factors contributed to Bishop’s
objectively reasonable basis for believing Hischke intended to commit
perjury. The police officers found a syringe in Hischke’s shirt pocket
when they patted him down outside of the apartment. Hischke was visiting
a friend who had an outstanding warrant for selling morphine and who
lives in an apartment openly littered with drug paraphernalia. As stated
above, this was not Hischke’s first brush with the law. He has two prior
marijuana convictions.</p>
<p>Given these facts, we find Bishop performed competently and
reasonably in deciding to inform the court of Hischke’s recent change in
testimony. Bishop’s belief was reasonable under these circumstances. He
did not merely suspect or guess Hischke would commit perjury. The facts
do not support a finding it was simply Bishop’s “gut-level belief”
Hischke planned to commit perjury. Moreover, his decision to act on this
personal belief is entirely consistent with “prevailing professional
norms.” Bishop was “convinced with good cause to believe defendant’s
proposed testimony would be deliberately untruthful.” Further, it was
not necessary for Bishop to conduct an independent investigation of the
facts.</p>
<p>We decline to adopt the standard of “actual knowledge” suggested by
Hischke. Such a standard would be virtually impossible to satisfy unless
the lawyer had a direct confession from his or her client or personally
witnessed the event in question. Consequently, the standard of actual
knowledge would eviscerate the rules of professional responsibility
forbidding a lawyer from presenting perjured testimony.</p>
<p>In finding Bishop’s performance was within the normal range of
competence we are not stating Bishop was required to take the particular
course of action he chose to pursue. This has not been presented to us.
We recognize when counsel is faced with the situation of client perjury,
he or she has competing interests at stake. Counsel must contend with
duties of zealous advocacy, confidentiality, and loyalty to the client.
On the other hand, these interests are counter-balanced by duties of
accountability to the courts and justice. In order to accommodate these
competing interests, there are various appropriate options a lawyer may
choose among to decide how to handle such a situation.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
IV. Conclusion
</p>
<p>We conclude Hischke’s trial counsel acted reasonably when he informed
the court his client intended to commit perjury. Hischke satisfied the
requisite standard that a lawyer must be “convinced with good cause to
believe the defendant’s proposed testimony would be deliberately
untruthful.” Because we find Hischke was not denied effective assistance
of counsel, we do not address whether Hischke has demonstrated
prejudice. We affirm.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
CARTER, Justice (concurring specially)
</p>
<p>I concur in affirming defendant’s conviction.</p>
<p>This case vividly illustrates the difficulty in determining whether a
lawyer has a sufficiently convincing reason to believe a client is about
to commit perjury. I have no disagreement with the test, which the
opinion of the court employs for making such determinations consistent
with the lawyer’s ethical obligation. Nor do I question the conclusion
of defendant’s counsel in the present case in the face of that test. The
decision could have gone either way on these facts.</p>
<p>This case does not discuss, because the issue is not raised, whether
the action that defendant’s counsel took upon becoming convinced of the
impending perjury was proper. I am convinced that it was not. My
disagreement with defense counsel’s action flows from a belief that it
is never proper for counsel to advise the court that counsel believes a
client will testify falsely. Such conduct will inevitably damage the
client’s case beyond repair.</p>
<p>Counsel who reach the conclusion that a client is about to testify
falsely should first attempt to dissuade the client from giving the
offending testimony. If unsuccessful, counsel should attempt a quiet
withdrawal from the representation. The reasons set forth in the
application to withdraw should only identify the existence of an
unspecified attorney-client disagreement that might compromise the
attorney’s ethical responsibilities. At no time should the matter of
impending perjury be disclosed. If the attempt to withdraw fails, then
counsel should proceed with the case and conduct any questioning of the
witness so as not to invite the suspected perjury. If the suspected
perjury nonetheless occurs, counsel should make no reference of it in
arguing the case to the trier of fact. I believe that if a lawyer
proceeds in this manner, he or she may fully satisfy the lawyer’s
ethical obligation to prevent perjury without the necessity of advising
the court as to the client’s intent to testify falsely.</p>

<h4>U.S. v. Long, 857 F. 2d 436 (8th Cir. 1988)</h4>
<p class="case-h1">
Heaney, Circuit Judge
</p>
<p>Thaddeus Adonis Long and Edward Larry Jackson appeal from their
convictions on a number of counts for their involvement in a check
forging and bank fraud scheme. We affirm their convictions on all
counts.</p>
<p>On August 14, 1986, the United States issued a treasury check in the
amount of $434,188.80, payable to Land O’Frost, an Illinois company. The
check was sent to Land O’Frost but ended up in the hands of Long or
Jackson. Jackson offered Dennis Mentzos $100.00 to assist him in cashing
the check. Mentzos accepted.</p>
<p>Jackson obtained a rubber stamp with “Land O’Frost” and the signature
of “James Frost” printed on it and an ID card in the name of John Turner
of Thermo-Dynamics. Mentzos signed the name John D. Turner on the ID
card. Mentzos and Jackson rented a telephone answering service listed
under the name Thermo-Dynamics.</p>
<p>Using the name John D. Turner, Mentzos opened an account at Norwest
Bank in downtown St. Paul and deposited $50.00. He supplied the bank
with a telephone number of Thermo-Dynamics and a reference, the State
Bank of St. Cloud. On the signature card, he signed the name John D.
Turner. At Jackson’s home in St. Paul, Jackson asked Mentzos to endorse
the check with the name John D. Turner. Mentzos refused but agreed to
sign a blank piece of paper. Jackson copied the signature on the back of
the check and stamped the Land O’Frost endorsement on it. An
acquaintance of Jackson deposited the treasury check, and the bank
credited the Thermo-Dynamics account in the amount of the check.</p>
<p>Long flew to Minnesota from Chicago. He registered at a hotel as
Mr. Kimball. On August 25, using the name Anthony Smith and posing as an
executive of Thermo-Dynamics, Long bought a Porsche automobile from a
dealer with a $28,000 Thermo-Dynamics check.</p>
<p>On August 26, Mentzos and Jackson picked up Long at his hotel.
Jackson gave Long various forms of false identification in the name of
Anthony Smith. They went to Norwest. Long signed the name Anthony Smith
on the Thermo-Dynamics signature card and obtained a number of starter
checks. Outside the bank, Mentzos signed, as John D. Turner, two of the
checks. Mentzos was later paid $100 and a bonus of $400 for his
help.</p>
<p>That same day, Long returned to Norwest and asked to cash a $16,000
check from Thermo-Dynamics payable to Irving Kimble. Long was given the
amount in cash.</p>
<p>On August 29, while at temporary offices which he had rented, Long
asked the receptionist on duty to type the name Anthony Smith under the
drawer signature line of a number of blank Norwest checks. Long asked
that one of those checks be made payable to Norwest Bank of St. Paul in
the amount of $56,685.</p>
<p>Norwest subsequently began an investigation of the Thermo-Dynamics
account. It discovered that the telephone number supplied by Mentzos was
for a residence and that the State Bank of St. Cloud did not exist. Long
went into the bank to cash the check for $56,685. After he endorsed the
check before a Norwest employee, the St. Paul police arrested him. An
officer searched Long’s belongings and found an Illinois driver’s
license, a Thermo-Dynamics identification card, and a Minnesota driver’s
license receipt, all in the name of Anthony Smith. The police apparently
arrested Jackson soon thereafter.</p>
<p>Jackson was indicted on seven counts. Jackson was found guilty on all
counts and sentenced to concurrent sentences of five years on the first
four counts, to a consecutive sentence of five years on the fifth count,
and to a consecutive sentence of five years on the sixth count. The
sentence on the seventh count was suspended, and a five-year term of
probation, to begin after Jackson’s release from prison, was imposed.
Thus, Jackson’s total sentence was fifteen years of imprisonment with
five years of probation.</p>
<p>Long was indicted on five counts. He was found guilty of all counts
and was sentenced to four years for the first two counts and consecutive
sentences of four years for the second two counts. The sentence on the
fifth count was suspended and a term of probation, to begin after
release from prison, was imposed. Thus, Long’s total sentence was twelve
years of imprisonment with five years of probation.</p>
<p>Long and Jackson claim a number of errors.</p>
<p class="case-h2">
D. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel
</p>
<p>Jackson contends his trial counsel was ineffective. To prevail on an
ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a defendant must show that his
or her attorney’s performance “fell below an objective standard of
reasonableness,” and that, but for this ineffective assistance, there is
a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been
different.</p>
<p>Jackson cites a number of instances of ineffectiveness. [ … ]</p>
<p>Finally, Jackson claims his attorney abandoned his role as Jackson’s
advocate and coerced Jackson not to testify. He allegedly did this by
suggesting to the trial judge, out of the presence of the jury, that his
client might perjure himself. This, according to Jackson, violated his
sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel and his fifth
amendment right to testify.</p>
<p>In <em>Nix v. Whiteside</em>, the Supreme Court addressed the
troubling question of how an attorney should respond upon learning a
client will commit perjury upon taking the stand. In that case, Emmanuel
Whiteside was convicted of the murder of Calvin Love. At trial,
Whiteside had claimed he stabbed Love in self-defense.</p>
<p>On collateral attack of that conviction, Whiteside alleged that his
right to counsel and to testify had been violated because, although he
took the stand, his attorney had coerced him not to testify that he had
seen a gun in Love’s hand before stabbing him. The trial court found
that Whiteside would have perjured himself if he testified that he had
seen the gun. It held that, because Whiteside’s rights to effective
assistance of counsel and to testify did not include the right to
testify falsely, those rights were not violated. This Court
reversed.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court overruled this Court. It held that when a defendant
“announces” an intention to commit perjury, the defendant’s rights to
effective assistance of counsel and to testify are not violated if the
attorney takes certain clear steps to prevent the presentation of that
false testimony. Those steps include attempting to dissuade the client
from testifying falsely, threatening to report the possibility of
perjury to the trial court, and possibly testifying against the
defendant should he be prosecuted for perjury. As the Court observed,
neither right was violated, because the right to testify does not
“extend to testifying falsely,” and because “the right to counsel
includes no right to have a lawyer who will cooperate with planned
perjury.”</p>
<p>In the instant case, Jackson’s lawyer asked to approach the bench
after the government had presented its case. The lawyer told the trial
judge that Jackson wanted to testify and that he was concerned about his
testimony. The lawyer said he advised Jackson not to take the stand. The
judge excused the jury and everyone else in the courtroom, except a
United States Marshal, Jackson, and his lawyer. At that point, the
lawyer said, “I’m not sure if it wouldn’t be appropriate for me to move
for a withdawal from this case based upon what I think may be elicited
on the stand. I’m concerned about the testimony that may come out and
I’m concerned about my obligation to the Court.” The trial judge
informed Jackson he had a right under the law to testify on his own
behalf, which Jackson said he understood. The court also informed
Jackson that his counsel was bound by his professional obligation not to
place evidence before the court which he believed to be untrue. Jackson
also said he understood this.</p>
<p>The judge stated that Jackson could take the stand and give a
narrative statement without questioning from his lawyer. The judge noted
that if Jackson’s attorney found “things which he believes to be not
true he may have other obligations at that point.” The lawyer responded
that he had again discussed the matter with Jackson and that Jackson had
decided, on his own, not to testify. Upon questioning by the judge,
Jackson again stated that he understood his right to testify and his
attorney’s obligations. Jackson thereupon informed the court that he did
not wish to testify.</p>
<p>This case differs from <em>Whiteside</em> in three respects. Each
difference raises important questions which can only be answered after
an evidentiary hearing.</p>
<p><em>First</em>, in <em>Whiteside</em>, a finding was made that
Whiteside would have testified falsely had he given the testimony he
initially wanted to give. Such a finding has not been made here. In
terms of a possible violation of Jackson’s rights, this is crucial. If,
for example, Jackson’s lawyer had no basis for believing Jackson would
testify falsely and Jackson, in fact, wanted to testify truthfully, a
violation of his rights would occur.</p>
<p>We do not know what measures Jackson’s attorney took to determine
whether Jackson would lie on the stand. He was required to take such
measures as would give him “a firm factual basis” for believing Jackson
would testify falsely. As we stated in our opinion in <em>Whiteside v.
Scurr</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Counsel must act if, but only if, he or she has “a firm factual
basis” for believing that the defendant intends to testify falsely or
has testified falsely. It will be a rare case in which this factual
requirement is met. Counsel must remember that they are not triers of
fact, but advocates. In most cases a client’s credibility will be a
question for the jury.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Supreme Court’s majority opinion in <em>Whiteside</em> emphasizes
the necessity of such caution on the part of defense counsel in
determining whether a client has or will commit perjury. In discussing
the attorney’s duty to report possible client perjury, the majority
states that it extends to “a client’s <em>announced plans</em> to engage
in future criminal conduct.” Thus, a clear expression of intent to
commit perjury is required before an attorney can reveal client
confidences.</p>
<p>The concurring opinions in <em>Whiteside</em> support this
interpretation. Justice Stevens advised circumspection: “A lawyer’s
certainty that a change in his client’s recollection is a harbinger of
intended perjury should be tempered by the realization that, after
reflection, the most honest witness may recall (or sincerely believe he
recalls) details that he previously overlooked.” And, Justice Blackmun
in his concurrence observed that “except in the rarest of cases,
attorneys who adopt ‘the role of the judge or jury to determine the
facts’ pose a danger of depriving their clients of the zealous and loyal
advocacy required by the Sixth Amendment.”</p>
<p>Justices Blackmun and Stevens focus in their concurring opinions on
the reasons the majority opinion carefully limits its holding to
“announced plans” to commit perjury. The tensions between the rights of
the accused and the obligations of her attorney are considerable in the
context of potential client perjury. Justice Stevens points to the
potential inaccuracy of a lawyer’s perception. For many reasons, a
lawyer’s perception may be incorrect. Ideally, a client will tell her
lawyer “everything.” But “everything” may not be one consistent
explanation of an event. Not only may a client overlook and later recall
certain details, but she may also change intended testimony in an effort
to be more truthful. Moreover, even a statement of an intention to lie
on the stand does not necessarily mean the client will indeed lie once
on the stand. Once a client hears the testimony of other witnesses,
takes an oath, faces a judge and jury, and contemplates the prospect of
cross-examination by opposing counsel, she may well change her mind and
decide to testify truthfully.</p>
<p>As Justice Blackmun observes, an attorney who acts on a belief of
possible client perjury takes on the role of the fact finder, a role
which perverts the structure of our adversary system. A lawyer who
judges a client’s truthfulness does so without the many safeguards
inherent in our adversary system. He likely makes his decision alone,
without the assistance of fellow fact finders. He may consider too much
evidence, including that which is untrustworthy. Moreover, a jury’s
determination on credibility is always tempered by the requirement of
proof beyond a reasonable doubt. A lawyer, finding facts on his own, is
not necessarily guided by such a high standard. Finally, by taking a
position contrary to his client’s interest, the lawyer may irrevocably
destroy the trust the attorney-client relationship is designed to
foster. That lack of trust cannot easily be confined to the area of
intended perjury. It may well carry over into other aspects of the
lawyer’s representation, including areas where the client needs and
deserves zealous and loyal representation. For these reasons and others,
it is absolutely essential that a lawyer have a firm factual basis
before adopting a belief of impending perjury.</p>
<p>The record before us does not disclose whether Jackson’s lawyer had a
firm factual basis for believing his client would testify falsely. This
can only be adequately determined after an evidentiary hearing.</p>
<p><em>Second</em>, in <em>Whiteside</em>, the defendant did testify and
was “‘restricted’ or restrained only from testifying falsely.” Here,
Jackson did not testify at all. It simply is impossible to determine
from the record before us whether Jackson was “restrained” by his lawyer
from giving truthful testimony. Again, this can only be determined after
an evidentiary hearing.</p>
<p><em>Third</em>, in <em>Whiteside</em>, the defense attorney did not
reveal his belief about his client’s anticipated testimony to the trial
court. In contrast, the disclosure to the trial court here was quite
explicit. The attorney said to the judge that he might have to withdraw
because of what might be elicited on the stand.</p>
<p>Such a disclosure cannot be taken lightly. Even in a jury trial,
where the judge does not sit as the finder of fact, the judge will
sentence the defendant, and such a disclosure creates “significant risks
of unfair prejudice” to the defendant.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">(n.6 in opinion) Before disclosing to the court a
belief of impending client perjury, not only must a lawyer have a firm
factual basis for the belief that his or her client will commit perjury,
but the lawyer must also have attempted to dissuade the client from
committing the perjury. Such dissuasion is usually in the defendant’s
interest because [ … ] “perjured testimony can ruin an otherwise
meritorious case.”<br>
<br>
</span></span></p>
<p>We note that, once the possibility of client perjury is disclosed to
the trial court, the trial court should reduce the resulting prejudice.
It should limit further disclosures of client confidences, inform the
attorney of his other duties to his client, inform the defendant of her
rights, and determine whether the defendant desires to waive any of
those rights.</p>
<p>The trial judge here acted primarily with these concerns in mind. The
judge discussed the conflict with only the attorney and his client
present. He prevented further disclosures of client confidences. He
advised Jackson of his right to testify and determined that Jackson
understood his rights and his attorney’s ethical obligation not to place
false testimony before the court. He advised Jackson that if he took the
stand, his lawyer would be required to refrain from questioning Jackson
on issues which the lawyer believed Jackson would perjure himself and
that Jackson would have to testify in narrative form.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">(n.7 in opinion) When a lawyer is confronted during
trial with the prospect of client perjury, allowing the defendant to
testify in narrative form was recommended by the American Bar
Association in its Standards for Criminal Justice, Proposed Standard
4-7.7. This Standard, however, has not been in force since 1979 when the
American Bar Association House of Delegates failed to approve it. It has
been criticized because it would indicate to the judge and sophisticated
jurors that the lawyer does not believe his client, and because the
lawyer would continue to play a passive role in the perjury. In this
case, these concerns were largely removed because the judge had already
been notified of the potential perjury and because the judge had
instructed the attorney to proceed in this manner.<br>
<br>
</span></span> He then directly asked Jackson if he wished to testify.
We add that a trial court should also impress upon defense counsel and
the defendant that counsel must have a firm factual basis before further
desisting in the presentation of the testimony in question.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">(n.8 in opinion) We believe a trial court should also
specifically inform a defendant of the possible consequences of false
testimony: (1) the lawyer may reveal to the court what he believes to be
false; (2) the lawyer may refrain from referring to the false testimony
in final argument; and (3) the defendant may be prosecuted for
perjury.<br>
<br>
</span></span></p>
<p>Under such a procedure, the chance for violations of the defendant’s
constitutional rights will be reduced, the revelation of further client
confidences will be prevented, and the defendant can make a knowing
waiver of her constitutional right to testify and to counsel. It will
also be necessary to establish that the waiver was voluntary and that
the defendant’s rights were not violated prior to the waiver. Such
inquiries, however, are best made at an evidentiary hearing.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
CONCLUSION
</p>
<p>The most weighty decision in a case of possible client perjury is
made by the lawyer who decides to inform the court, and perhaps
incidentally his adversary and the jury, of his client’s possible
perjury. This occurs when the lawyer makes a motion for withdrawal
(usually for unstated reasons) or allows his client to testify in
narrative form without questioning from counsel. Once this has been
done, the die is cast. The prejudice will have occurred. At a minimum,
the trial court will know of the defendant’s potential perjury. For this
reason, defense counsel must use extreme caution before revealing a
belief of impending perjury. It is, as Justice Blackmun noted, “the
rarest of cases” where an attorney should take such action.</p>
<p>Once the disclosure of the potential client perjury has occurred, the
trial judge can limit the resulting prejudice by preventing further
disclosures of client confidences, by informing the attorney of the
obligation to his client, and by informing the client of her rights and
determining whether she desires to waive any of them.</p>
<p>The determination whether the prejudice was undue must occur at an
evidentiary hearing. Two alternatives are available in this case for an
evidentiary hearing:<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">(n.10 in opinion) Various methods have been suggested
by commentators as an alternative to such a post hoc procedure. For
example, one suggests that before allowing a defendant to give what a
lawyer believes is perjurious testimony, a recess should be called, and
a judge, other than the presiding judge, should hold a hearing and
determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant would commit
perjury by testifying. Another suggests creating a board of attorneys to
decide ethical issues. Either of these procedures would assist attorneys
in determining whether there is a firm factual basis for believing a
client is about to commit perjury, although we do not say, at this
point, that the Constitution necessarily requires their
implementation.<br>

§ 2255 proceeding. In <em>United States v. Dubray</em>, we observed that
claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are normally raised for the
first time in collateral proceedings. Since Jackson’s claim is, in part,
one of ineffective assistance of counsel, we hold that a collateral
proceeding would be the proper forum to address the claimed violations
of Jackson’s rights to effective assistance of counsel and to
testify.</p>
<p>We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court but without
prejudice to Jackson to claim in a section 2255 proceeding an
infringement of his rights to effective assistance of counsel and to
testify.</p>

<h4>In re Litz, 721 N.E.2d 258 (Ind. 1999)</h4>
<p>The respondent, Steven C. Litz, defended a woman accused of neglect
of a dependent. While a retrial of that case proceeded, the respondent
caused to be published in several newspapers a letter which stated his
client had committed no crime, criticized the prosecutor’s decision to
retry the case, and mentioned that his client had passed a lie detector
test. For that, we find today that the respondent violated Ind.
Professional Conduct Rule 3.6(a), which forbids attorneys from making
extrajudicial statements which they know or reasonably should have known
a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative
proceeding.</p>
<p>This case is now before us for approval of a <em>Statement of
Circumstances and Conditional Agreement for Discipline</em> reached by
the parties in resolution of this matter pursuant to Ind. Admission and
Discipline Rule 23 &amp; 11(c). Our jurisdiction here is a result of the
respondent’s admission to this state’s bar on October 12, 1984.</p>
<p>The parties agree that the respondent represented a client in
criminal proceeding in Morgan County in which a jury found the client
guilty of neglect of a dependent resulting in serious bodily injury. The
respondent represented the client in the appeal of her conviction and
succeeded in obtaining a reversal of the conviction from the Indiana
Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals remanded the case to the trial
court, finding that the lower court erred in determining that evidence
of “battered women’s syndrome” was irrelevant and inadmissible in the
first trial.</p>
<p>After remand on June 2, 1997, the trial court set the matter for a
new jury trial on November 3, 1997. On June 25, 1997, a “Letter to the
Editor” written and submitted by the respondent appeared in the
Bloomington, Indiana <em>Herald-Times</em> and the Mooresville, Indiana
<em>Times</em>. An identical letter from the respondent appeared in the
June 26, 1997, edition of the <em>Indianapolis Star</em>. The
respondent’s letter stated this his client had spent the “last 18 months
in jail for a crime she did not commit” and revealed that she had passed
a lie detector test. The letter also decried the decision to retry his
client, characterizing it as “abominable.” On September 29, 1997, the
respondent, on behalf of the client, filed a <em>Motion for Change of
Venue</em> from Morgan County, citing “prejudicial pre-trial publicity.”
The court granted the motion.</p>
<p>Indiana Professional Conduct Rule 3.6(a) provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lawyer shall not make an extrajudicial statement that a reasonable
person would expect to be disseminated by means of public communication
if the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that it will have a
substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative
proceeding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indiana Professional Conduct Rule 3.6(b) provides that certain types
of extrajudicial [sic] statements referred to in subsection (a) are
“rebuttably presumed” to have a substantial likelihood of materially
prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding, including the results of any
examination or test, any opinion as to the guilt or innocence of a
defendant in a criminal case that could result in incarceration, or
information that the lawyer knows or reasonably should know is likely to
be inadmissible as evidence in a trial.</p>
<p>Preserving the right to a fair trial necessarily entails some
curtailment of the information that may be disseminated about a party
prior to trial, particularly where trial by jury is involved. The
respondent’s letters to area newspapers created a substantial likelihood
of material prejudice to the pending jury retrial of the respondent’s
own client. Some of the statements contained therein presumptively
presented that risk: his description of evidence that could have been
inadmissible at trial (i.e., the fact and result of the lie detector
test), and his opinion that his client did not commit the crime for
which she was charged. Further, the respondent’s identification of the
prosecution’s decision to retry the case as “abominable,” despite the
fact that retrial of the case was well within the prosecutor’s
discretion, tended to contribute to a pre-trial atmosphere prejudicial
to the prosecution’s case. In sum, the respondent’s letters created an
environment where a fair trial was much less likely to occur.
Additionally, the respondent effectively set the stage for his own
subsequent motion for change of venue based on prejudicial pre-trial
publicity. Accordingly, we find that the respondent’s published
commentary created a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing
retrial of his client’s criminal case, and thus violated Prof. Cond. R.
3.6(a).</p>
<p>The parties agree that the appropriate sanction for the misconduct is
a public reprimand. Among the factors we consider in assessing the
adequacy of that proposed sanction are aggravating and mitigating
circumstances. In mitigation, the parties agree that the respondent has
not previously been the subject of a disciplinary proceeding, that he
cooperated with the Commission, and that he continued to represent the
client through the resolution of her case. No factors in aggravation
were cited.</p>
<p>We view the respondent’s actions as a purposeful attempt to gain an
unfair advantage in retrial of his client’s case. Although the
respondent had no real selfish motive (and instead apparently sought
only to advocate zealously his client’s cause), he nonetheless was bound
to do so only within the bounds of our ethical rules. His public
comments were inappropriate because they threatened or in fact impinged
the prospect of a fair trial for his client. Whether extrajudicial
statements of this sort warrant reprimand or suspension is fact
sensitive. Here, we take into account the fact that the respondent’s
primary motivation appears to have been the welfare of his client. We
are also cognizant while assessing the proposed sanction of our policy
of encouraging agreed resolution of disciplinary cases. We find that, in
this case, the agreed sanction of a public reprimand is appropriate.</p>

Special Responsibilities of a Prosecutor
</p>
<p>The prosecutor in a criminal case shall:</p>
<p>(a) refrain from prosecuting a charge that the prosecutor knows is
not supported by probable cause;</p>
<p>(b) make reasonable efforts to assure that the accused has been
advised of the right to, and the procedure for obtaining, counsel and
has been given reasonable opportunity to obtain counsel;</p>

important pretrial rights, such as the right to a preliminary
hearing;</p>
<p>(d) make timely disclosure to the defense of all evidence or
information known to the prosecutor that tends to negate the guilt of
the accused or mitigates the offense, and, in connection with
sentencing, disclose to the defense and to the tribunal all unprivileged
mitigating information known to the prosecutor, except when the
prosecutor is relieved of this responsibility by a protective order of
the tribunal;</p>
<p>(e) not subpoena a lawyer in a grand jury or other criminal
proceeding to present evidence about a past or present client unless the
prosecutor reasonably believes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) the information sought is not protected from disclosure by any
applicable privilege;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) the evidence sought is essential to the successful completion of
an ongoing investigation or prosecution; and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(3) there is no other feasible alternative to obtain the
information;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(f) except for statements that are necessary to inform the public of
the nature and extent of the prosecutor’s action and that serve a
legitimate law enforcement purpose, refrain from making extrajudicial
comments that have a substantial likelihood of heightening public
condemnation of the accused and exercise reasonable care to prevent
investigators, law enforcement personnel, employees or other persons
assisting or associated with the prosecutor in a criminal case from
making an extrajudicial statement that the prosecutor would be
prohibited from making under Rule 3.6 or this Rule.</p>
<p>(g) When a prosecutor knows of new, credible and material evidence
creating a reasonable likelihood that a convicted defendant did not
commit an offense of which the defendant was convicted, the prosecutor
shall:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) promptly disclose that evidence to an appropriate court or
authority, and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) if the conviction was obtained in the prosecutor’s
jurisdiction,</p>
</blockquote>

authorizes delay, and</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(ii) undertake further investigation, or make reasonable efforts to
cause an investigation, to determine whether the defendant was convicted
of an offense that the defendant did not commit.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>(h) When a prosecutor knows of clear and convincing evidence
establishing that a defendant in the prosecutor’s jurisdiction was
convicted of an offense that the defendant did not commit, the
prosecutor shall seek to remedy the conviction.</p>
<p class="case-h3">
Comments
</p>
<p>[1] A prosecutor has the responsibility of a minister of justice and
not simply that of an advocate. This responsibility carries with it
specific obligations to see that the defendant is accorded procedural
justice, that guilt is decided upon the basis of sufficient evidence,
and that special precautions are taken to prevent and to rectify the
conviction of innocent persons. The extent of mandated remedial action
is a matter of debate and varies in different jurisdictions. Many
jurisdictions have adopted the ABA Standards of Criminal Justice
Relating to the Prosecution Function, which are the product of prolonged
and careful deliberation by lawyers experienced in both criminal
prosecution and defense. Competent representation of the sovereignty may
require a prosecutor to undertake some procedural and remedial measures
as a matter of obligation. Applicable law may require other measures by
the prosecutor and knowing disregard of those obligations or a
systematic abuse of prosecutorial discretion could constitute a
violation of Rule 8.4.</p>
<p>[7] When a prosecutor knows of new, credible and material evidence
creating a reasonable likelihood that a person outside the prosecutor’s
jurisdiction was convicted of a crime that the person did not commit,
paragraph (g) requires prompt disclosure to the court or other
appropriate authority, such as the chief prosecutor of the jurisdiction
where the conviction occurred. If the conviction was obtained in the
prosecutor’s jurisdiction, paragraph (g) requires the prosecutor to
examine the evidence and undertake further investigation to determine
whether the defendant is in fact innocent or make reasonable efforts to
cause another appropriate authority to undertake the necessary
investigation, and to promptly disclose the evidence to the court and,
absent court-authorized delay, to the defendant. Consistent with the
objectives of Rules 4.2 and 4.3, disclosure to a represented defendant
must be made through the defendant’s counsel, and, in the case of an
unrepresented defendant, would ordinarily be accompanied by a request to
a court for the appointment of counsel to assist the defendant in taking
such legal measures as may be appropriate.</p>
<p>[8] Under paragraph (h), once the prosecutor knows of clear and
convincing evidence that the defendant was convicted of an offense that
the defendant did not commit, the prosecutor must seek to remedy the
conviction. Necessary steps may include disclosure of the evidence to
the defendant, requesting that the court appoint counsel for an
unrepresented indigent defendant and, where appropriate, notifying the
court that the prosecutor has knowledge that the defendant did not
commit the offense of which the defendant was convicted.</p>
<p>[9] A prosecutor’s independent judgment, made in good faith, that the
new evidence is not of such nature as to trigger the obligations of
sections (g) and (h), though subsequently determined to have been
erroneous, does not constitute a violation of this Rule.</p>

<section id="aba-criminal-justice-standards-for-the-prosecution-function-2017" class="level4">
<h4>ABA Criminal Justice Standards for the Prosecution Function
(2017)</h4>
<p class="case-h1">
Standard 3-1.2: Functions and Duties of the Prosecutor
</p>
<p>(a) The prosecutor is an administrator of justice, a zealous
advocate, and an officer of the court. The prosecutor’s office should
exercise sound discretion and independent judgment in the performance of
the prosecution function.</p>
<p>(b) The primary duty of the prosecutor is to seek justice within the
bounds of the law, not merely to convict. The prosecutor serves the
public interest and should act with integrity and balanced judgment to
increase public safety both by pursuing appropriate criminal charges of
appropriate severity, and by exercising discretion to not pursue
criminal charges in appropriate circumstances. The prosecutor should
seek to protect the innocent and convict the guilty, consider the
interests of victims and witnesses, and respect the constitutional and
legal rights of all persons, including suspects and defendants.</p>
<p>(c) The prosecutor should know and abide by the standards of
professional conduct as expressed in applicable law and ethical codes
and opinions in the applicable jurisdiction. The prosecutor should avoid
an appearance of impropriety in performing the prosecution function. A
prosecutor should seek out, and the prosecutor’s office should provide,
supervisory advice and ethical guidance when the proper course of
prosecutorial conduct seems unclear. A prosecutor who disagrees with a
governing ethical rule should seek its change if appropriate, and
directly challenge it if necessary, but should comply with it unless
relieved by court order.</p>
<p>(d) The prosecutor should make use of ethical guidance offered by
existing organizations, and should seek to establish and make use of an
ethics advisory group akin to that described in Defense Function
Standard 4-1.11.</p>
<p>(e) The prosecutor should be knowledgeable about, consider, and where
appropriate develop or assist in developing alternatives to prosecution
or conviction that may be applicable in individual cases or classes of
cases. The prosecutor’s office should be available to assist community
efforts addressing problems that lead to, or result from, criminal
activity or perceived flaws in the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>(f) The prosecutor is not merely a case-processor but also a
problem-solver responsible for considering broad goals of the criminal
justice system. The prosecutor should seek to reform and improve the
administration of criminal justice, and when inadequacies or injustices
in the substantive or procedural law come to the prosecutor’s attention,
the prosecutor should stimulate and support efforts for remedial action.
The prosecutor should provide service to the community, including
involvement in public service and Bar activities, public education,
community service activities, and Bar leadership positions. A
prosecutorial office should support such activities, and the office’s
budget should include funding and paid release time for such
activities.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
Standard 3-1.3: The Client of the Prosecutor
</p>
<p>The prosecutor generally serves the public and not any particular
government agency, law enforcement officer or unit, witness or victim.
When investigating or prosecuting a criminal matter, the prosecutor does
not represent law enforcement personnel who have worked on the matter
and such law enforcement personnel are not the prosecutor’s clients. The
public’s interests and views should be determined by the chief
prosecutor and designated assistants in the jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
Standard 3-1.4: The Prosecutor’s Heightened Duty of Candor
</p>
<p>(a) In light of the prosecutor’s public responsibilities, broad
authority and discretion, the prosecutor has a heightened duty of candor
to the courts and in fulfilling other professional obligations. However,
the prosecutor should be circumspect in publicly commenting on specific
cases or aspects of the business of the office.</p>
<p>(b) The prosecutor should not make a statement of fact or law, or
offer evidence, that the prosecutor does not reasonably believe to be
true, to a court, lawyer, witness, or third party, except for lawfully
authorized investigative purposes. In addition, while seeking to
accommodate legitimate confidentiality, safety or security concerns, a
prosecutor should correct a prosecutor’s representation of material fact
or law that the prosecutor reasonably believes is, or later learns was,
false, and should disclose a material fact or facts when necessary to
avoid assisting a fraudulent or criminal act or to avoid misleading a
judge or factfinder.</p>
<p>(c) The prosecutor should disclose to a court legal authority in the
controlling jurisdiction known to the prosecutor to be directly adverse
to the prosecution’s position and not disclosed by others.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
Standard 3-1.6: Improper Bias Prohibited
</p>
<p>(a) The prosecutor should not manifest or exercise, by words or
conduct, bias or prejudice based upon race, sex, religion, national
origin, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, or
socioeconomic status. A prosecutor should not use other improper
considerations, such as partisan or political or personal
considerations, in exercising prosecutorial discretion. A prosecutor
should strive to eliminate implicit biases, and act to mitigate any
improper bias or prejudice when credibly informed that it exists within
the scope of the prosecutor’s authority.</p>
<p>(b) A prosecutor’s office should be proactive in efforts to detect,
investigate, and eliminate improper biases, with particular attention to
historically persistent biases like race, in all of its work. A
prosecutor’s office should regularly assess the potential for biased or
unfairly disparate impacts of its policies on communities within the
prosecutor’s jurisdiction, and eliminate those impacts that cannot be
properly justified.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
Standard 3-1.12: Duty to Report and Respond to Prosecutorial Misconduct
</p>
<p>(a) The prosecutor’s office should adopt policies to address
allegations of professional misconduct, including violations of law, by
prosecutors. At a minimum such policies should require internal
reporting of reasonably suspected misconduct to supervisory staff within
the office, and authorize supervisory staff to quickly address the
allegations. Investigations of allegations of professional misconduct
within the prosecutor’s office should be handled in an independent and
conflict-free manner.</p>
<p>(b) When a prosecutor reasonably believes that another person
associated with the prosecutor’s office intends or is about to engage in
misconduct, the prosecutor should attempt to dissuade the person. If
such attempt fails or is not possible, and the prosecutor reasonably
believes that misconduct is ongoing, will occur, or has occurred, the
prosecutor should promptly refer the matter to higher authority in the
prosecutor’s office including, if warranted by the seriousness of the
matter, to the chief prosecutor.</p>
<p>(c) If, despite the prosecutor’s efforts in accordance with sections
(a) and (b) above, the chief prosecutor permits, fails to address, or
insists upon an action or omission that is clearly a violation of law,
the prosecutor should take further remedial action, including revealing
information necessary to address, remedy, or prevent the violation to
appropriate judicial, regulatory, or other government officials not in
the prosecutor’s office.</p>

<section id="berger-v.-united-states-295-u.s.-78-1935" class="level4">
<h4>Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78 (1935)</h4>
<p class="case-h1">
MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.
</p>
<p>Petitioner was indicted in a federal district court charged with
having conspired with seven other persons named in the indictment to
utter counterfeit notes purporting to be issued by designated federal
reserve banks, with knowledge that they had been counterfeited. The
indictment contained eight additional counts alleging substantive
offenses. Among the persons named in the indictment were Katz, Rice and
Jones. Rice and Jones were convicted by the jury upon two of the
substantive counts and the conspiracy count. Petitioner was convicted
upon the conspiracy count only. Katz pleaded guilty to the conspiracy
count, and testified for the government upon an arrangement that a
<em>nolle prosequi</em> as to the substantive counts would be entered.
It is not necessary now to refer to the evidence further than to say
that it tended to establish not a single conspiracy as charged but two
conspiracies — one between Rice and Katz and another between Berger,
Jones and Katz. The only connecting link between the two was that Katz
was in both conspiracies and the same counterfeit money had to do with
both. There was no evidence that Berger was a party to the conspiracy
between Rice and Katz. During the trial, the United States attorney who
prosecuted the case for the government was guilty of misconduct, both in
connection with his cross-examination of witnesses and in his argument
to the jury.</p>
<p>That the United States prosecuting attorney overstepped the bounds of
that propriety and fairness which should characterize the conduct of
such an officer in the prosecution of a criminal offense is clearly
shown by the record. He was guilty of misstating the facts in his
cross-examination of witnesses; of putting into the mouths of such
witnesses things which they had not said; of suggesting by his questions
that statements had been made to him personally out of court, in respect
of which no proof was offered; of pretending to understand that a
witness had said something which he had not said and persistently
cross-examining the witness upon that basis; of assuming prejudicial
facts not in evidence; of bullying and arguing with witnesses; and in
general, of conducting himself in a thoroughly indecorous and improper
manner. The trial judge, it is true, sustained objections to some of the
questions, insinuations and misstatements, and instructed the jury to
disregard them. But the situation was one which called for stern rebuke
and repressive measures and, perhaps, if these were not successful, for
the granting of a mistrial. It is impossible to say that the evil
influence upon the jury of these acts of misconduct was removed by such
mild judicial action as was taken.</p>
<p>The prosecuting attorney’s argument to the jury was undignified and
intemperate, containing improper insinuations and assertions calculated
to mislead the jury. A reading of the entire argument is necessary to an
appreciation of these objectionable features. The following is an
illustration: A witness by the name of Goldie Goldstein had been called
by the prosecution to identify the petitioner. She apparently had
difficulty in doing so. The prosecuting attorney, in the course of his
argument, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Goldie Goldstein takes the stand. She says she knows Jones, and
you can bet your bottom dollar she knew Berger. She stood right where I
am now and looked at him and was afraid to go over there, and when I
waved my arm everybody started to holler, ‘Don’t point at him.’ You know
the rules of law. Well, it is the most complicated game in the world. I
was examining a woman that I knew knew Berger and could identify him,
she was standing right here looking at him, and I couldn’t say, ‘Isn’t
that the man?’ Now, imagine that! But that is the rules of the game, and
I have to play within those rules.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The jury was thus invited to conclude that the witness Goldstein knew
Berger well but pretended otherwise; and that this was within the
personal knowledge of the prosecuting attorney.</p>
<p>Again, at another point in his argument, after suggesting that
defendants’ counsel had the advantage of being able to charge the
district attorney with being unfair “of trying to twist a witness,” he
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But, oh, they can twist the questions, they can sit up in their
offices and devise ways to pass counterfeit money; ‘but don’t let the
Government touch me, that is unfair; please leave my client alone.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The United States Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary
party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern
impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and
whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it
shall win a case, but that justice shall be done. As such, he is in a
peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the twofold aim
of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer. He may
prosecute with earnestness and vigor — indeed, he should do so. But,
while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul
ones. It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated
to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means
to bring about a just one.</p>
<p>It is fair to say that the average jury, in a greater or less degree,
has confidence that these obligations, which so plainly rest upon the
prosecuting attorney, will be faithfully observed. Consequently,
improper suggestions, insinuations and, especially, assertions of
personal knowledge are apt to carry much weight against the accused when
they should properly carry none. The court below said that the case
against Berger was not strong; and from a careful examination of the
record we agree. Indeed, the case against Berger, who was convicted only
of conspiracy and not of any substantive offense as were the other
defendants, we think may properly be characterized as weak — depending,
as it did, upon the testimony of Katz, an accomplice with a long
criminal record.</p>
<p>In these circumstances prejudice to the cause of the accused is so
highly probable that we are not justified in assuming its non-existence.
If the case against Berger had been strong, or, as some courts have
said, the evidence of his guilt “overwhelming,” a different conclusion
might be reached. Moreover, we have not here a case where the misconduct
of the prosecuting attorney was slight or confined to a single instance,
but one where such misconduct was pronounced and persistent, with a
probable cumulative effect upon the jury which cannot be disregarded as
inconsequential. A new trial must be awarded.</p>

<h4>Taylor v. Kavanagh, 640 F. 2d 450 (2d Cir. 1981)</h4>
<p class="case-h1">
IRVING R. KAUFMAN, Circuit Judge
</p>
<p>Plaintiff Rodney Taylor, <em>pro se</em>, instituted this action
against Michael Kavanagh, an Assistant District Attorney for Ulster
County, New York. Claiming that Kavanagh lied to him during plea
negotiations and violated the terms of the negotiated plea agreement,
Taylor seeks to set aside a criminal conviction resulting from his
guilty plea. He also requests compensatory and punitive damages
amounting to $5.5 million.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
I.
</p>
<p>Taylor was arrested in Kingston, New York, in October 1974, and on
December 20, 1974, he was indicted and charged with third degree
burglary and attempted grand larceny. He was taken into custody again on
August 14, 1975, and charged with third degree burglary and criminal
possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree.</p>
<p>On June 9, 1976, Taylor, represented by counsel, pleaded guilty in
the Ulster County Court to the third degree burglary charge contained in
the December 1974 indictment. This plea was in full satisfaction of the
charges resulting from both the October 1974 and the August 1975
arrests, although no indictment concerning the events of August 1975 had
ever been returned. The court was advised that Taylor and Assistant
District Attorney Kavanagh had agreed that no recommendation or
statement would be made relating to the sentence to be imposed.</p>
<p>On June 7, 1977, Taylor moved in the state court to vacate his guilty
plea, claiming that 1) during plea negotiations and at the time he
entered his plea, the Assistant District Attorney had misrepresented to
him and the court that a grand jury had returned an indictment on the
charges relating to the August 1975 arrest; and 2) Kavanagh had
indicated he would not abide by his promise not to recommend any
sentence. This motion was denied.</p>
<p>At the sentencing proceeding in February 1978, Kavanagh made a
lengthy and detailed statement concerning Taylor’s prior criminal record
and recommended that he receive the maximum punishment. The court then
sentenced Taylor to an indeterminate term of six years, with a minimum
term of two years. Taylor appealed the judgment of conviction, but the
Appellate Division affirmed, ordering, however, that Taylor be
resentenced. The court stated that although the misrepresentation by the
prosecutor concerning the existence of the second indictment was
harmless error, resentencing was necessary because the prosecutor failed
to honor his promise. Taylor eventually was resentenced to the same term
he had previously received.</p>
<p>Taylor filed the instant action in October 1978, claiming he was
induced to plead guilty by the Assistant District Attorney’s
misrepresentations concerning the alleged second indictment. He also
asserted that he should be awarded damages for Kavanagh’s breach of the
plea bargain.</p>
<p>The defendant moved for judgment on the pleadings, which Judge Griesa
granted in July 1980. He reasoned that because a prosecutor does not
have custody over a convicted prisoner, Kavanagh was not a proper
defendant in the suit to set aside Taylor’s conviction. Extending the
doctrine of absolute immunity to a prosecutor’s plea bargaining
activities. Judge Griesa also held that Kavanagh was immune from
liability, and dismissed the action. We affirm.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
II.
</p>
<p>We note at the outset that when a prisoner is challenging his
imprisonment in state facilities, his sole federal remedy is a writ of
habeas corpus. Taylor followed this approach in September 1979, seeking
a writ in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
New York. Judge Port dismissed the petition and denied a certificate of
probable cause. Taylor did not appeal this order. Accordingly, we hold
that he cannot raise this request to be set free in the instant civil
rights action.</p>
<p>Taylor’s damages claim also fails because the Assistant District
Attorney’s conduct in the plea bargaining negotiations and the
sentencing proceeding in state court is protected by the doctrine of
absolute prosecutorial immunity. <em>Imbler v. Pachtman</em>, 424 U.S.
409 (1976), provided the basis for the development of a functional
approach to the immunity question. The Court held that absolute immunity
from § 1983 liability exists for those prosecutorial activities
“intimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.”
These protected “quasi-judicial” activities include the initiation of a
prosecution and the presentation of the Government’s case.</p>
<p>Absolute protection does not extend, however, to a prosecutor’s
investigative or administrative acts. Accordingly, we have recognized
that where prosecutors act in this capacity, only the qualified “good
faith” immunity that protects, for example, police officers, is
available.</p>
<p>The task of determining whether a particular activity is better
characterized as “quasi-judicial” and subject to absolute immunity, or
“investigative” and subject to only qualified “good faith” immunity
requires more than the mechanical application of labels. An examination
of the functional nature of prosecutorial behavior, rather than the
status of the person performing the act, is determinative. Thus, a
prosecutor is insulated from liability where his actions directly
concern the pre-trial or trial phases of a case. For example, the
swearing of warrants to insure a witness’s attendance at trial, the
falsification of evidence and the coercion of witnesses, or the failure
to drop charges until immediately before trial, have been held to be
prosecutorial activities for which absolute immunity applies. Similarly,
because a prosecutor is acting as an advocate in a judicial proceeding,
the solicitation and subornation of perjured testimony, the withholding
of evidence, or the introduction of illegally-seized evidence at trial
does not create liability in damages. The rationale for this approach is
sound, for these protected activities, while deplorable, involve
decisions of judgment affecting the course of a prosecution. The
efficient, and just, performance of the prosecutorial function would be
chilled if Government attorneys were forced to worry that their choice
of trial strategy and tactics could subject them to monetary liability,
or at best, the inconvenience of proving a “good faith” defense to a §
1983 action.</p>
<p>In contrast, activities in which a prosecutor engages that are
independent of prosecution are not protected by the doctrine of absolute
immunity. For example, only a “good faith” immunity is available where a
prosecutor testifies falsely as a witness, distributes extraneous
statements to the press designed to harm a suspect’s reputation, or
participates in an illegal search that violates a suspect’s Fourth
Amendment rights.</p>
<p>Decisions to engage in conduct of this character are not directly
related to the delicate judgments prosecutors must make concerning the
development of the Government’s case. The “investigatory” and
“administrative” work involved in testifying before a grand jury,
accumulating evidence, and disseminating information to the press is
analogous to the tasks performed by the police, and therefore only the
same qualified “good faith” immunity is available.</p>
<p>This functional approach requires us to evaluate plea bargaining in
light of the general purpose of the absolute immunity doctrine. Judge
Griesa properly recognized that the purpose of the doctrine “is to
insure that a prosecutor will perform his difficult function with
complete vigor and independence, undeterred by the spectre of liability
for damages with respect to his activities.” Learned Hand has told us
that the doctrine we apply today supports the just administration of the
criminal law, for we all would suffer if prosecutors “who try to do
their duty were subject to the constant dread of retaliation.” The
threat of § 1983 liability would inhibit prosecutors from exercising
independent judgment and would divert their attention from the immediate
matters at hand.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
III.
</p>
<p>We are satisfied that a prosecutor’s activities in the plea
bargaining context merit the protection of absolute immunity. The plea
negotiation is an “essential component” of our system of criminal
justice. It is at this stage that the prosecutor evaluates the evidence
before him, determines the strength of the Government’s case, and
considers the societal interest in disposing of the case by a negotiated
guilty plea. The effective negotiation of guilty pleas would be severely
chilled if a prosecutor were constantly concerned with the possibility
of ruinous personal liability for judgments and decisions made at this
critical stage of the criminal process.</p>
<p>Moreover, reference to the type of harm suffered from the alleged
misconduct during a plea negotiation demonstrates that defendant
Kavanagh should be afforded absolute immunity in this case. We recently
noted that there can be no monetary liability for injuries related
solely to the prosecution itself. Thus, if as a result of prosecutorial
misconduct, a defendant is compelled to face prosecution, or to suffer
imprisonment or pretrial detention, the harm cannot be redressed via a §
1983 civil rights suit. But, where the alleged harm is inflicted
independently from the prosecution—for example, the damage to reputation
caused by a prosecutor’s dissemination of false information to the press
or the violation of Fourth Amendment privacy rights resulting from a
prosecutor’s authorization of an illegal search—the prosecutor cannot
rely on the blanket protection of absolute immunity. In this case, the
only harm caused by Kavanagh’s purported misrepresentations and his
failure to abide by a promise was imprisonment, an injury for which the
<em>Imbler</em> doctrine of immunity protects the prosecutor.</p>
<p>Finally, we note that by extending the doctrine of absolute immunity
to a prosecutor’s plea bargaining activities, we do not condone
Kavanagh’s alleged misconduct. Prosecutorial abuses can and should be
remedied at the trial and appellate levels, as well as by state and
federal post-conviction collateral procedures. Relief for misconduct
committed during a plea negotiation includes the setting aside of the
plea or ordering specific performance of the agreement. In this case,
Taylor raised vigorous objections to Kavanagh’s conduct in state court.
He also employed the federal habeas corpus procedure, without success.
His failure to prevail in both the state and federal forums cannot
justify the creation of another remedy, one which would impose a
tremendous burden on society by severely undercutting prosecutorial
independence and morale.</p>

<h4>In re Jordan, 913 So. 2d 775 (La. 2005)</h4>
<p class="case-h1">
TRAYLOR, J.
</p>
<p>This attorney disciplinary matter arises from formal charges filed by
the Office of Disciplinary Counsel against respondent, Roger W. Jordan,
Jr., a former Orleans Parish prosecutor.</p>
<p>On April 22, 2003, the ODC filed one count of formal charges against
respondent, alleging that he violated Rules 3.8(d) and 8.4(a) of the
Rules of Professional Conduct by failing to timely disclose to the
defense evidence tending to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigate
the offense. The formal charges against respondent arise from the
capital prosecution of Shareef Cousin and respondent’s undisputed
failure to turn over an eyewitness’s statement to the defense.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
Facts and Procedural History of <em>State v. Cousin</em>:
</p>
<p>Before addressing the merits of the case, it is necessary to discuss,
in some detail, the underlying facts and procedural history of Shareef
Cousin’s criminal case.</p>
<p>On March 2, 1995, Michael Gerardi was shot at point-blank range
during an armed robbery attempt outside the Port of Call restaurant in
New Orleans. Connie Ann Babin, Mr. Gerardi’s date that evening and the
only eyewitness to the murder, gave three separate statements to the New
Orleans Police Department during the homicide investigation. When
questioned on the night of the murder, a “visibly shaken” Ms. Babin told
the police that she “did not get a good look at the perpetrators and
probably could not identify them.” In the second statement, which was
tape recorded by police at Ms. Babin’s home on March 5, 1995, three days
after the murder, Ms. Babin was asked by a New Orleans Police Department
detective whether she could “describe the person who did the shooting,
his clothing?” In response, Ms. Babin said that she remembered the
shooter was wearing an oversized denim jacket. She continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t know, it was dark and I did not have my contacts nor my
glasses so I’m coming at this at a disadvantage. I you know you could
see outlines and shapes and things that stick out, but er … the socks, I
remember the colorful socks, because he kept drawing my attention to it
when he kept fidgeting at his ankle area.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ms. Babin went on to describe the shooter’s hair and to say that the
shooter was in his late teens and five feet seven or eight inches tall.
After providing this description, Ms. Babin stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As he looked to me I keep getting this vision of a young man with,
with an older man’s face … er I don’t know that if this is coming … er
somewhere, or if I really did see this person … if this is just coming
from my imagination or what, but I … every time I go over it and close
my eyes er … I remember thinking that he had an older man’s face or a
young body, on a young person … how I visualize that, I don’t know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On March 25, 1995, three weeks after the murder, Ms. Babin viewed a
photographic lineup presented by the police and positively identified
sixteen-year old Shareef Cousin as the shooter. Mr. Cousin was arrested
a short time later and indicted for the first degree murder of
Mr. Gerardi.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1995, the criminal case was assigned to respondent,
then an assistant district attorney in Orleans Parish. When respondent
was first assigned the case, he recalls that there were three
identification witnesses. However, Ms. Babin was the only witness to
positively identify Mr. Cousin.</p>
<p>In preparing for trial, respondent interviewed Ms. Babin. She
informed him that she is nearsighted and only needs her contacts or
glasses for nighttime driving, but not to see at close distances.
Considering this information, respondent unilaterally determined that
the absence of contacts or glasses on the night of the murder did not
affect Ms. Babin’s identification of Mr. Cousin as the shooter.</p>
<p>Respondent testified at his disciplinary hearing that he believed
Ms. Babin’s second statement provided significant additional details
that tended to corroborate her identification of Mr. Cousin, especially
the observation of the killer as having “an old man’s face” on “a young
person’s body.” Respondent therefore concluded that, in his judgment,
Ms. Babin’s second statement was not material exculpatory evidence to
which the defense would be entitled under <em>Brady v. Maryland</em>.
Accordingly, he did not produce that statement to Mr. Cousin’s attorneys
in response to their motion for the production of exculpatory evidence.
Respondent has never maintained that he was unaware of his obligation as
a prosecutor to disclose exculpatory evidence pursuant to
<em>Brady</em>.</p>
<p>Prior to the trial, Mr. Cousin’s defense team filed a motion to
suppress Ms. Babin’s identification of Mr. Cousin. Ms. Babin testified
at the suppression hearing, and, in response to questions by respondent,
explained the manner by which she came to identify Mr. Cousin in the
photographic lineup conducted by the NOPD. On cross-examination,
Mr. Cousin’s attorney questioned Ms. Babin as to whether she had given a
description of the perpetrator to the police “when they questioned you
about this case.” Ms. Babin testified she described the perpetrator as
youthful, slim, slightly shorter than Mr. Gerardi, with short cropped
hair and a very distinctive “unusual” or “evil-looking” face.
Mr. Cousin’s attorney also asked whether Ms. Babin told the police
“about any characteristics that you felt were outstanding.” Ms. Babin
said that she could only recall stating “that he had an older-looking
face on a younger body.” While Mr. Cousin’s attorney attempted to
discover whether or not Ms. Babin had given any additional descriptions
to anyone else prior to the photographic lineup, respondent objected,
and the question was rephrased. Eventually, Mr. Cousin’s attorney
questioned Ms. Babin as to whether she had provided any additional
statements to the police other than the night of the murder and the
photographic lineup. Ms. Babin testified that her description had been
consistent throughout. Thus, the only way that the defense could have
known about Statement 2 would have been disclosure by respondent.</p>
<p>Ms. Babin testified at trial and repeated her positive identification
of Mr. Cousin. Mr. Cousin was convicted of first degree murder. The same
jury subsequently sentenced him to death in a bifurcated penalty
phase.</p>
<p>Several days after the completion of the guilt phase of the trial but
before the penalty phase, a copy of Statement 2 was delivered
anonymously to defense counsel. On appeal, the defense raised as error
respondent’s failure to produce Statement 2 prior to trial. This Court
did not reach that issue. Instead, a unanimous Court reversed
Mr. Cousin’s conviction and death sentence based on the erroneous
admission of a witness’ testimony as impeachment evidence and
respondent’s improper use of that evidence in closing argument.
Nevertheless, the Court commented in footnotes that Ms. Babin’s second
statement was “obviously” exculpatory, material to the issue of guilt,
and “clearly” should have been produced to the defense under
<em>Brady</em> and <em>Kyles v. Whitley</em>.</p>
<p>Following this court’s decision in <em>Cousin</em>, the Orleans
Parish District Attorney’s Office elected not to retry Mr. Cousin for
the murder of Michael Gerardi.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
Disciplinary Proceedings
</p>
<p class="case-h2">
Disciplinary Complaint
</p>
<p>In May 1998, Mr. Cousin and his sister, Tonya Cropper, filed a
complaint against respondent with the ODC, alleging, among other things,
that respondent wrongfully suppressed <em>Brady</em> evidence by failing
to disclose Ms. Babin’s second statement. In his July 1998 response to
the complaint, respondent asserted his belief that the witness’s
statement at issue was more inculpatory than exculpatory, and his
determination that disclosure of the statement was not required by
<em>Brady</em>. Respondent reiterated this assertion in his sworn
statement taken by the ODC on June 16, 1999.</p>
<p>Following its investigation, the ODC dismissed the complaint against
respondent. Ms. Cropper appealed the dismissal, but the hearing
committee found that the ODC did not abuse its discretion in dismissing
the complaint. Subsequently, the disciplinary board remanded the matter
to the ODC with instructions to file formal charges against
respondent.</p>
<p class="case-h2">
Formal Hearing
</p>
<p>The hearing committee conducted a formal hearing on the charges. ODC
called several witnesses in its case in chief, including respondent,
Shareef Cousin’s defense attorney, and the complainant, Tonya Cropper.
Respondent presented character testimony from several members of the
bench and bar.</p>
<p class="case-h2">
Hearing Committee Recommendation
</p>
<p>In a split decision, the chair and the public member of the committee
found that the ODC did not prove a violation of Rules 3.8(d) and 8.4(a)
as charged, and recommended that the formal charges against respondent
be dismissed. In a nineteen page report, the majority found respondent’s
testimony credible regarding the nature of the <em>Brady</em> material.
The committee acknowledged that respondent was in possession of the
statement yet failed to disclose the second statement to the defense.
However, the committee found no violation of Rule 3.8, as the committee
determined that respondent reasonably believed that Ms. Babin’s
statement was inculpatory rather than exculpatory. The committee
concluded that the defense was aware of the second statement and that it
did not believe that the prosecution had an obligation “to help out the
defense” by providing the statement. Based on these factual
determinations, the majority of the committee concluded that respondent
did not violate the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>
<p>The lawyer member of the committee dissented, noting her objection to
the majority’s interpretation of a prosecutor’s duty under
<em>Brady</em>. She commented that she did not believe that the
prosecutor has the discretion to determine whether to disclose
exculpatory evidence to the defense. Rather, she interpreted
<em>Brady</em> as imposing an affirmative duty on the prosecutor to
disclose material exculpatory evidence, irrespective of whether a
request was made by the defense.</p>
<p>The ODC filed an objection to the hearing committee’s report and
recommendation.</p>
<p class="case-h2">
Ruling of the Disciplinary Board
</p>
<p>The disciplinary board determined that respondent technically
violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, but found that no discipline
was appropriate and dismissed the formal charges against respondent.
While the board adopted the hearing committee’s factual findings, it
rejected the committee’s legal conclusions and application of the Rules
of Professional Conduct. The board determined that the committee erred
in its finding that respondent did not violate either <em>Brady</em> or
Rule 3.8(d) when he failed to produce Ms. Babin’s second statement. The
board concluded that respondent was ethically bound to voluntarily
disclose Statement 2, which tended to negate the guilt of the accused by
calling into question Ms. Babin’s positive identification of Cousin as
the perpetrator of the crime. By failing to do so, respondent violated
Rule 3.8(d).</p>
<p>The board found no aggravating factors present in this case, but
found “numerous and weighty” mitigating factors, including the absence
of a prior disciplinary record, absence of a dishonest or selfish
motive, full and free disclosure to the disciplinary board and a
cooperative attitude toward the proceedings, character and reputation,
and remorse. The board concluded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the board finds that respondent’s actions constitute a
technical violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct, considering
all of the factors, particularly respondent’s good faith and lack of
intent, the lack of any actual injury, respondent’s excellent reputation
among judges and colleagues and his unblemished disciplinary record, and
considering the purpose of lawyer discipline, the board finds that no
formal discipline is warranted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on this reasoning, the formal charges against respondent were
dismissed.</p>
<p>The ODC sought review of the board’s ruling in this Court. We ordered
the parties to submit briefs addressing the issue of whether the record
supports the disciplinary board’s report. After reviewing the briefs
filed by both parties, we docketed the matter for oral argument.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
Discussion
</p>
<p>In our system of justice, we entrust vast discretion to a prosecutor.
Because a prosecutor is given such great power and discretion, he is
also charged with a high ethical standard. A prosecutor stands as the
representative of the people of the State of Louisiana. He is entrusted
with upholding the integrity of the criminal justice system by ensuring
that justice is served for both the victims of crimes and the accused.
“Society wins not only when the guilty are convicted but when criminal
trials are fair; our system of the administration of justice suffers
when any accused is treated unfairly.” The actions, or inactions in this
case, of the prosecutor are paramount to a fair administration of
justice; and the people of this state must have confidence in a
prosecutor’s integrity in performing his duty to disclose exculpatory
evidence in order for the system to be just. Any intentional deviation
from the principle of the fair administration of justice will be dealt
with harshly by this Court.</p>
<p>This is a case of first impression in the State of Louisiana. Never
before have we been confronted with the issue of disciplining a
prosecutor for failing to disclose “evidence or information known to the
prosecutor that tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigates
the offense, and, in connection with sentencing, disclose to the defense
and to the tribunal all unprivileged mitigating information known to the
prosecutor.” The language of Rule 3.8(d) is recognizably similar to the
prosecutor’s duty set forth in <em>Brady</em> and its progeny. Moreover,
the Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure likewise imposes a
corresponding statutory duty on a prosecutor to disclose exculpatory
evidence to the defendant.</p>
<p>The duty of a prosecutor to disclose exculpatory evidence is embedded
in the principle that a criminal defendant is deprived of a fair trial
when the state withholds exculpatory evidence that is material to guilt
or punishment. The state’s failure to disclose material evidence
favorable to a criminal defendant implicates more than the defendant’s
discovery rights; the prosecutor has an affirmative duty to disclose
such evidence under the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.
Failure to reveal this evidence implicates the defendant’s right to a
fair trial.</p>
<p>Whether the questioned evidence is material under <em>Brady</em> has
been explained by this Court in <em>Marshall</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The issue is whether the exculpatory evidence is material under the
<em>Brady</em>-<em>Bagley</em>-<em>Kyles</em> line of cases. Evidence is
material only if it is reasonably probable that the result of the
proceeding would have been different had the evidence been disclosed to
the defense. A reasonable probability is one which is sufficient to
undermine confidence in the outcome. This Court must provide a
cumulative evaluation of the suppressed evidence, keeping in mind that
Marshall does not have to show that, with the addition of the suppressed
evidence, his trial would have resulted in acquittal or that there would
be an insufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction. Marshall
need only show that “disclosure of the suppressed evidence to competent
counsel would have made a different result reasonably probable.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During his testimony before the hearing committee, respondent
testified that he did not believe Ms. Babin’s second statement was
material and did not qualify as the type of evidence to be disclosed
under <em>Brady</em>. Specifically, respondent stated that he thought
the evidence was inculpatory rather than exculpatory as Ms. Babin
recounted specific details regarding the defendant’s clothing and
colorful socks. While the definition of materiality set forth in
<em>Kyles</em> and its progeny may be seen as leaving a prosecutor with
a degree of discretion, it does not.</p>
<p>Exculpatory evidence includes evidence which impeaches the testimony
of a witness whose credibility or reliability may determine guilt or
innocence. Additionally, <em>United States v. Bagley</em> reiterates the
principle that there is no distinction between exculpatory evidence and
impeachment evidence under <em>Brady</em>. Clearly, Ms. Babin’s second
statement negates her ability to positively identify the defendant in a
lineup. The statement should have been disclosed to the defense. As we
noted in our decision overruling Mr. Cousin’s conviction, citing Justice
Souter’s eloquent statement in <em>Kyles</em>, a prosecutor anxious
about “tacking too close to the wind will disclose a favorable piece of
evidence” and “will resolve doubtful questions in favor of disclosure.”
Respondent failed to produce evidence which was clearly exculpatory and
should have resolved this issue in favor of disclosure.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we agree with the factual findings of the disciplinary
board that respondent violated Rule 3.8(d) by failing to disclose the
second statement of Ms. Babin to the defendant.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
Sanctions
</p>
<p>In considering the issue of sanctions, we are mindful that
disciplinary proceedings are designed to maintain high standards of
conduct, protect the public, preserve the integrity of the profession,
and deter future misconduct. The discipline to be imposed depends upon
the facts of each case and the seriousness of the offenses involved,
considered in light of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances.
Thus, we must consider the facts as they are presented herein in
deciding the type of discipline to impose on respondent.</p>
<p>The violation of Rule 3.8(d) by a prosecutor raises a great deal of
concern to this Court. Rule 3.8(d) exists to ensure that the integrity
of the prosecutorial arm of our criminal justice system is maintained.
Moreover, prosecutors are in a unique position from other members of the
bar as they are immune from civil liability under <em>Imbler v.
Pachtman</em>. Neither are they realistically subject to criminal
sanctions. Our research reveals only one instance in which a judge held
a prosecutor in contempt of court for failing to disclose evidence.
Thus, absent consequences being imposed by this Court under its
authority over disciplinary matters, prosecutors face no realistic
consequences for <em>Brady</em> violations.</p>
<p>In deciding the appropriate sanction, we begin our analysis with
Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10(C), which sets forth the following
considerations in imposing discipline:</p>
<p>1. Whether the lawyer has violated a duty owed to a client, to the
public, to the legal system, or to the profession;</p>
<p>2. Whether the lawyer acted intentionally, knowingly, or
negligently;</p>
<p>3. The amount of the actual or potential injury caused by the
lawyer’s misconduct; and</p>
<p>4. The existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors.</p>
<p>By withholding material exculpatory evidence from a criminal
defendant, respondent violated a duty owed to the public. As a
prosecutor, respondent is charged with a high ethical standard and may
not carelessly skirt his obligation. Although neither <em>Brady</em> nor
Rule 3.8 incorporates a mental element, Rule XIX, § 10(C) does. Based on
the testimony of respondent and the character evidence discussed below,
we find that respondent knowingly withheld Brady evidence. As to the
element regarding actual injury, this Court reversed Shareef Cousin’s
conviction on other grounds and granted him a new trial. However, this
Court’s actions in reversing the conviction does not vitiate the
potential injury to the criminal justice system, or to Cousin, caused by
respondent’s actions, and warrants serious consideration and discipline
by this Court.</p>
<p>As to the issue of aggravating and mitigating factors, we find the
only aggravating factor present in this case is respondent’s substantial
experience as a prosecutor. However, on the issue of mitigation, we find
a host of factors present. Specifically, we find the absence of any
prior disciplinary record, absence of a dishonest motive, full and free
disclosure to the board, a cooperative attitude towards the proceedings,
and good character and reputation in the legal community.</p>
<p>As stated above, the issue of discipline against a prosecutor for his
violation of Rule 3.8 is <em>res nova</em> in the State of Louisiana.
While this Court has the benefit of Rule XIX considerations, we have no
prior case law on the issue. However, Louisiana is not the first
jurisdiction to address the issue of a prosecutor’s failure to disclose
evidence to a defendant. Our brethren in North Carolina, Kansas, South
Carolina, Ohio and Iowa have imposed discipline against an attorney who
fails to disclose evidence pursuant to Brady. Thus, we find some
guidance in their decisions. The sanctions imposed in other
jurisdictions range from public reprimand or censure to a six-month
suspension from the practice of law. Based upon the facts of this case,
we conclude the appropriate baseline sanction for respondent’s
misconduct is a three-month suspension from the practice of law.
However, in light of the mitigating factors, we will defer this
suspension in its entirety, subject to the condition that any misconduct
during a one-year period following the finality of this judgment may be
grounds for making the deferred suspension executory, or imposing
additional discipline, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
JOHNSON, J. concurs in part, dissents in part, for the reasons that
follow.
</p>
<p>I concur in the majority’s opinion that respondent knowingly withheld
<em>Brady</em> evidence, that respondent’s experience as a prosecutor
was an aggravating factor, that the Court’s actions in reversing
defendant’s conviction failed to invalidate the potential injury to the
criminal justice system, or to defendant, and that respondent’s behavior
warrants discipline by this Court. However, because of the actual injury
caused by respondent’s prosecutorial misconduct, I dissent from the
majority’s conclusion that respondent’s suspension should be
deferred.</p>
<p>As cited in the majority opinion, Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, §
10(c) sets forth four factors to be considered when imposing lawyer
discipline. The third factor in this analysis is the “amount of the
actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer’s misconduct.” Regarding
actual injury, the majority opinion states that “this Court reversed
Shareef Cousin’s conviction on other grounds and granted him a new
trial.” Thus, the majority opinion adopts the reasoning, stated
explicitly by the disciplinary board in the lower proceedings, that no
injury resulted from respondent’s conduct since the defendant’s
conviction was reversed. Although reversal of defendant’s sentence of
death by lethal injection amends the wrongful sentence, it fails to
negate the actual injury caused by respondent’s misconduct.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Louisiana Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10(c), this court has
held that an attorney caused an actual injury because the attorney’s
failure to pay a client’s medical bill resulted in a negative report to
a credit agency. In another matter, we determined that an attorney
caused an actual injury when he abandoned his legal practice and failed
to return a $750 fee to a client and delayed the client’s legal
proceedings. In my view, the taking of a liberty interest is an even
greater injury. As one legal commentator noted, “liberty is absolute and
the loss of it is the greatest of all human injustices.” Indeed, how can
we ignore the injury caused by the wrongful taking of freedom, or the
despair that inevitably follows as a defendant sits on death row and
prepares for execution by lethal injection. “The execution of a legally
and factually innocent person would be a constitutionally intolerable
event,” wrote Justice Sandra Day O’Connor in <em>Herrera v.
Collins</em>. It is noteworthy that Shareef Cousin faced this
predicament at the age of sixteen. The United States Supreme Court has
since determined that execution of individuals who were under the age of
18 at the time of their capital crimes is unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Wrongful conviction constitutes an actual injury. Moreover, the
United States Supreme Court has held that a wrongful conviction “has
continuing collateral consequences.” Michael Anthony Williams, who was
recently freed from Angola State Penitentiary after serving 24 years for
a crime he did not commit, and who, like Shareef Cousin, was convicted
at the age of sixteen, described his time in prison as “a living hell.”
He stated that “a lot of terrible things happened to me while I was in
there.” Williams confessed that when he was younger, he was sexually
abused “while guards turned their backs.” Persons wrongfully convicted
lose time during incarceration that cannot be retrieved. Furthermore,
inmates, generally, leave prison with no savings, dismal employment
prospects, and oftentimes medical and mental issues. Wrongful conviction
can also cause significant stress on family relationships including the
financial pressure that may have been created by legal fees associated
with the wrongful conviction.</p>
<p>In the present case, disciplinary charges were filed against
respondent by Shareef Cousin and his sister, Tonya Cropper. Tonya
Cropper’s testimony at the Hearing Committee describes the emotional
turmoil that the Cousin family endured as a result of defendant’s
wrongful conviction.</p>
<p>In 1976, the United States Supreme Court held that individual
prosecutors have absolute immunity under common law tort claims as well
as section 1983 suits. This court adopted the <em>Imbler</em> court’s
reasoning in <em>Knapper v. Connick</em>, when we determined that
“prosecutors are entitled to absolute immunity for conduct within the
course and scope of their prosecutorial functions.” Thus, prosecutors
have absolute immunity even in instances, such as the present case,
where the prosecutor suppressed exculpatory information. However, the
<em>Imbler</em> decision also identifies the legal community’s
responsibility for maintaining the integrity of prosecutors and
deterring prosecutors from violating standards of the legal profession.
The court concluded that “a prosecutor stands perhaps unique, among
officials whose acts could deprive persons of constitutional rights, in
his amenability to professional discipline by an association of his
peers.” Therefore, our function in dispensing disciplinary action is
critical both for upholding the highest ethical and professional
standards among prosecutors and ensuring fundamental fairness for
defendants. As expressed by the Honorable Calvin Johnson of Orleans
Parish Criminal Court, in a letter contained in the record to then
Orleans Parish District Attorney Harry Connick, Rule 3.8 was established
to ensure professional responsibility among lawyers as well as to
guarantee the constitutional due process rights of criminal
defendants.</p>
<p>In determining whether respondent caused an actual injury pursuant to
Louisiana’s Supreme Court Rule XIX, § 10(c), our focus should be on the
unnecessary and unlawful suffering of the wrongfully convicted as a
result of the prosecutorial misconduct, not just the reversal of the
wrongfully imposed sentence. Because, in my view, loss of a liberty
interest is more valuable than financial loss or injury to one’s credit,
I would impose an actual period of suspension.</p>

<h4>Hillman v. Nueces County, 579 S.W.3d 354 (Tex. 2019)</h4>
<p class="case-h1">
JEFFREY S. BOYD, Justice.
</p>
<p>A former assistant district attorney filed this suit alleging that
the county wrongfully terminated his employment because he refused his
supervisor’s order to withhold exculpatory evidence from a criminal
defendant. The trial court dismissed the suit for lack of jurisdiction,
and the court of appeals affirmed. Because we agree with those courts
that governmental immunity bars the suit, we also affirm.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
I. Background
</p>
<p>Eric Hillman served as an assistant district attorney in Nueces
County for two years. While preparing to prosecute a defendant charged
with intoxicated assault and leaving the scene of an accident, Hillman
discovered and interviewed a witness who said she was with the defendant
the night of the incident and he was not intoxicated. Because the police
report did not identify this witness, Hillman told his supervisor that
he needed to disclose the witness to the defendant’s attorney. The
supervisor disagreed and instructed Hillman not to disclose the witness.
Believing that he was legally required to disclose the witness, Hillman
called the State Bar Ethics Hotline and the Texas Center for Legal
Ethics for advice. Both told him he should disclose the information.</p>
<p>Three days before the defendant’s trial, the victim confirmed to
Hillman that the witness had been present at the scene. Hillman relayed
this information to his supervisor and informed her that he had decided
to disclose the witness to the defense attorney. On the day of trial,
Hillman was fired for “failing to follow instructions.” He alleges he
was fired solely for refusing to withhold exculpatory evidence.</p>
<p>Hillman sued the County, the District Attorney’s Office, and
then-District Attorney Mark Skurka, in his official capacity, seeking
actual damages for lost wages and benefits, mental anguish, pain and
suffering, and loss of earning capacity, and exemplary damages. The
County moved to dismiss on the ground that governmental immunity bars
Hillman’s claims. The trial court agreed and dismissed the case, and the
court of appeals affirmed.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
II. Governmental Immunity
</p>
<p>Sovereign immunity—usually called governmental immunity when
referring to political subdivisions—protects governmental entities
against suits and legal liabilities. The County pleaded immunity from
both suit and liability in this case, but only immunity from suit
implicates the courts’ jurisdiction. Because the trial court dismissed
this case for lack of jurisdiction, we focus here solely on governmental
immunity from suit. Because Hillman filed suit seeking money damages
against a county and its department and official, governmental immunity
bars this suit unless immunity has been waived.</p>
<p>Like every court of appeals that has addressed the issue, the court
of appeals concluded here that governmental immunity applies to
Hillman’s wrongful-termination claim and has not been waived. Presenting
three alternative grounds for reversal, Hillman argues that (1) this
Court abrogated or waived the County’s immunity from this type of suit
in <em>Sabine Pilot Service, Inc. v. Hauck</em>, in which we recognized
a cause of action for wrongful termination of an at-will employee for
refusal to perform an illegal act, (2) the Texas legislature waived the
County’s immunity through the Michael Morton Act, or (3) we should
abrogate or waive the County’s immunity from such suits today. Although
Hillman and his supporting amici bolster these grounds with serious and
important policy concerns, we ultimately find the grounds themselves
unconvincing.</p>
<p class="case-h2">
A. Sabine Pilot
</p>
<p>Texas—“steadfastly an at-will employment state”—generally permits
both employers and employees to terminate their relationship at any time
for any reason unless they contractually agree otherwise. The law
recognizes, however, a number of exceptions to this rule. One “very
narrow exception to the employment-at-will doctrine,” which we adopted
in <em>Sabine Pilot</em>, prohibits employers from terminating at-will
employees “for the sole reason that the employee refused to perform an
illegal act.” An employer who terminates an employee solely for that
reason is liable to the employee for all resulting “reasonable tort
damages, including punitive damages.”</p>
<p><em>Sabine Pilot</em> involved claims against a private-sector
employer, and this Court’s very brief opinion never mentioned the duties
or obligations of government employers. Noting that the Court did not
expressly limit the exception to private employers or declare it
inapplicable to government employers, Hillman argues that <em>Sabine
Pilot</em> prohibits all employers—government as well as private—from
terminating at-will employees solely for refusing to perform an illegal
act. This argument reads too much into <em>Sabine Pilot</em>. Nothing in
that opinion indicates anything regarding government employers. Because
we simply did not consider or address whether the exception applies to
government employers in <em>Sabine Pilot</em>, it provides no
controlling principle on that issue here.</p>
<p>Hillman suggests that even if <em>Sabine Pilot</em> did not resolve
the issue, we can and should clarify today that the <em>Sabine
Pilot</em> exception applies to government employers. We have no problem
holding that the exception applies to all Texas employers, in the sense
that they all have a common-law-tort duty not to terminate at-will
employees solely because the employee refuses to perform an illegal act.
But holding that the <em>Sabine Pilot</em> exception applies to
government employers does not help Hillman. Hillman’s problem is not
that the duty does not apply to government employers, but that immunity
bars any suit for a government employer’s breach of that duty.</p>
<p>Governmental immunity protects all governmental entities against
suits and liabilities for their governmental actions, even when acting
as employers. The legislature has provided a limited waiver of that
immunity for certain tort and breach-of-contract actions. These statutes
do not create tort or contractual duties or impose them on governmental
entities. Those common-law duties preexist the statutes and apply to
governmental entities as to anyone else, but immunity bars suits for
breach of those duties.</p>
<p>Instead of creating or imposing duties, the statutes waive the
immunity that would otherwise protect the government, removing the
barrier that precludes suits or liability for breach of those
preexisting common-law duties. So although we can say that the
common-law-tort duty we recognized in <em>Sabine Pilot</em> applies to
all Texas employers, Hillman still cannot pursue this suit for the
County’s alleged breach of that duty unless the legislature has waived
the County’s governmental immunity. Because <em>Sabine Pilot</em> did
not involve a governmental defendant and did not address governmental
immunity or its waiver, it does not support Hillman’s argument that the
trial court had jurisdiction over his claim.</p>
<p class="case-h2">
B. The Michael Morton Act
</p>
<p>More than fifty-five years ago, the United States Supreme Court held
that the Constitution’s due-process clause prohibits criminal
prosecutors from suppressing material evidence that is “favorable to an
accused.” Just over five years ago, the Texas legislature statutorily
addressed “Brady violations” by passing the Michael Morton Act. The
Michael Morton Act expressly requires prosecutors to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>disclose to the defendant any exculpatory, impeachment, or mitigating
document, item, or information in the possession, custody, or control of
the state that tends to negate the guilt of the defendant or would tend
to reduce the punishment for the offense charged.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prosecutors must disclose such information whenever they discover it,
whether “before, during, or after trial.”</p>
<p>Hillman contends that the Michael Morton Act required him to disclose
the witness’s information in the case he was prosecuting, so the County
wrongfully terminated him for refusing to perform an illegal act. But
even accepting these assertions as true, the issue here is not whether
Hillman has pleaded a valid <em>Sabine Pilot</em> claim, but whether the
Act waives the County’s governmental immunity against that claim.</p>
<p>To waive governmental immunity, a statute must use “clear and
unambiguous language” expressing that intent. When deciding whether a
statute clearly and unambiguously waives governmental immunity, we</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>consider “whether the statutory provisions, even if not a model
of clarity, waive immunity without doubt”;</p></li>
<li><p>resolve any “ambiguity as to waiver in favor of retaining
immunity”;</p></li>
<li><p>generally find waiver “if the Legislature requires that the
governmental entity be joined in a lawsuit even though the entity would
otherwise be immune from suit”;</p></li>
<li><p>consider whether the legislature “provided an objective
limitation on the governmental entity’s potential liability”;
and</p></li>
<li><p>consider “whether the statutory provisions would serve any
purpose absent a waiver of immunity.”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Like the <em>Sabine Pilot</em> opinion, the Michael Morton Act does
not address governmental immunity or waiver at all. None of its language
waives immunity “without doubt” or even creates any ambiguity on the
point. The Act does not require that the government be joined in any
lawsuit or impose any limitation on the government’s potential liability
in such a suit. Implicating only the fifth consideration, Hillman argues
that the Act necessarily must waive the County’s immunity from his
wrongful-termination suit because the Act’s sole purpose is to require
prosecutors to disclose exculpatory evidence. He contends that the Act
would be “illusory” unless it waives immunity from <em>Sabine Pilot</em>
claims, and finding no waiver “would defeat the sole purpose for passing
the Michael Morton Act in the first place.” As Hillman puts it, “A law
making it a crime for a prosecutor to withhold evidence from the
defense, but at the same time allowing the prosecutor’s supervisor to
fire him for refusing to do so is nonsensical and cannot possibly be
what the legislature intended when it enacted the Michael Morton
Act.”</p>
<p>These arguments read too much into the Michael Morton Act. The Act
serves obvious purposes separate and apart from addressing any
wrongful-termination issues. It codifies and “supplements” prosecutors’
constitutional obligations under <em>Brady</em>. It requires production
of several items that “previously were not discoverable” in criminal
cases, including “written witness statements, written communications
between the State and its agents, and work product.” And violations of
the Act may constitute grounds for reversing a conviction.</p>
<p>Of course, the legislature could always do more to ensure that
prosecutors disclose exculpatory information. Presumably, at least,
prosecutors would be more likely to disclose such information if the Act
authorized civil-damages suits—and waived immunity for such suits—
against those who violate its requirements or who terminate subordinates
who refuse to violate them. Whether countervailing policy concerns
outweigh such benefits, however, “is the very essence of legislative
choice.” And the mere fact that a statute prohibits a government
official from engaging in particular conduct does not establish that the
statute also waives governmental immunity whenever a government employer
terminates an employee for refusing to engage in that conduct. If that
were true, every statutory prohibition would waive immunity from
wrongful-termination claims.</p>
<p>Nothing in the Michael Morton Act indicates a legislative intent to
waive governmental immunity from a wrongful-termination suit under
<em>Sabine Pilot</em>. No explicit language or even ambiguous language
indicates such an intent. We hold that the Michael Morton Act does not
waive the County’s governmental immunity from this suit.</p>
<p class="case-h2">
C. Judicial Abrogation of Immunity
</p>
<p>Alternatively, Hillman urges us to abolish the “ancient and
antiquated” doctrine of governmental immunity altogether, or at least
modify it to allow for <em>Sabine Pilot</em> claims against governmental
entities. He notes that sovereign immunity developed and exists as a
common-law doctrine, and “it remains the judiciary’s responsibility to
define the boundaries of the common-law doctrine and to determine under
what circumstances sovereign immunity exists in the first instance.” But
in fulfilling that responsibility, we must respect both our precedent
and our limitations under the constitutional separation of powers.</p>
<p>Having existed for more than six hundred years, the
governmental-immunity doctrine is “an established principle of
jurisprudence in all civilized nations.” We first recognized it as a
principle of Texas law more than 170 years ago. Although the
justifications for its existence have evolved through the years, we have
steadfastly retained it in modern times precisely because it shields
“the public from the costs and consequences of improvident actions of
their governments,” and ensures that the taxes the public pays are used
“for their intended purposes.”</p>
<p>We are not blind to the truism that, “just as immunity is inherent to
sovereignty, unfairness is inherent to immunity.” But as the Court’s
majority explained in that case, we resolve that concern by deferring to
the legislature, as the policy-making branch of government, “to decide
whether and to what extent that immunity should be waived.” As important
as Hillman’s and his supporting amici’s policy concerns may be, they do
not justify discarding these fundamental principles of Texas law.</p>
<p>We in no way discount the serious policy concerns that Hillman, his
supporting amici, and today’s concurring opinion express. Governmental
immunity from <em>Sabine Pilot</em> claims eliminates one means by which
the law could ensure that prosecutors disclose exculpatory evidence as
<em>Brady</em> and the Michael Morton Act require. As the amici note,
the Act has enjoyed broad, bipartisan support in the legislature, the
public, and the press, and the legislature has further strengthened the
Act in more recent legislative sessions. But to hold that governmental
immunity does not apply to <em>Sabine Pilot</em> claims, we must
trespass across the boundary between defining immunity’s scope (a
judicial task) and waiving it (a legislative task). The distinction
between scope and waiver is “a fine one,” and we must “be very hesitant
to declare immunity nonexistent in any particular case,” lest we use our
authority to define the scope as “a ruse for avoiding the
Legislature.”</p>
<p>As we have repeatedly confirmed, “it is the Legislature’s sole
province to waive or abrogate sovereign immunity.” That the legislature
has recently revised the Michael Morton Act to strengthen its
protections illustrates its continuing awareness of the Act and its
importance, as well as its willingness to take steps to improve it.
Whether waiving immunity from <em>Sabine Pilot</em> claims should be the
next step in that process is up to the legislature, and we must defer to
it to “protect its policymaking function.”</p>
<p class="case-h1">
III. Conclusion
</p>
<p>“Sovereign immunity from suit defeats a trial court’s subject matter
jurisdiction.” When, as here, a claim falls within the realm of
governmental immunity, courts have no jurisdiction to hear the case
unless immunity has been waived. We hold that neither <em>Sabine
Pilot</em> nor the Michael Morton Act waives the County’s governmental
immunity from Hillman’s wrongful-termination claim, and we defer to the
legislature to decide whether such a waiver would be appropriate as a
matter of public policy. We affirm the trial court’s judgment granting
the County’s plea to the jurisdiction and dismissing the case.</p>

<p>Imagine being accused, charged, and convicted of bludgeoning your
spouse to death. You are innocent but sentenced to life in prison,
effectively orphaning your only child. Over the next 24 years, you wage
an uphill battle to prove your innocence, eventually discovering that
the prosecution held the keys to your jail cell before you ever set foot
in it. Eyewitness testimony pointing the finger at someone else and DNA
evidence that was never tested would have exculpated you if the
prosecutor had not secreted the evidence from those who were
constitutionally charged with defending you. Ultimately exonerated after
nearly a quarter century in confinement, you walk free. The
prosecutor—now a judge—is found in contempt of court for suppressing
this evidence. Small comfort. Justice delayed is justice denied. But
more than that, justice delayed is life denied.</p>
<p>While you were locked away for a crime you did not commit, you were
denied your unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness. You lost your constitutional right to parent your child. To
have his love and companionship. To shape who he is and how he became
that way. Instead, your beautiful toddler is now a man struggling to
reconnect with a person he doesn’t know, can’t remember as a parent, and
spent years thinking was a vicious monster. And worse, the actual
perpetrator of this heinous crime continued to walk the streets. Free to
kill again.</p>
<p>Alas, this is not a hypothetical. This is the true story of Michael
Morton. Husband. Father. Supermarket manager. An ordinary Texan whose
young wife fell victim to a stranger’s brutality. And while Morton
languished in jail, another young wife—Debra Baker—paid the ultimate
price at the hands of the same killer, leaving yet another young child
motherless. Foreseeable victims of overzealous prosecution.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. Official misconduct
has been a factor in more than half of the nationally reported
exonerations since 1989—nearly four score of which have occurred in
Texas. Wrongful convictions are anathema to our constitution. And
suppression of evidence is anathema to the duty of a prosecutor to seek
justice. Concealment of exculpatory evidence undermines the integrity of
our criminal justice system, which is of vital importance to every one
of us: “Society wins not only when the guilty are convicted but when
criminal trials are fair. The administration of justice suffers when any
accused is treated unfairly.”</p>
<p>The tragic story of Michael Morton and Debra Baker compelled the
Legislature to take affirmative steps to prevent wrongful convictions
due to prosecutorial misconduct. In the legislative session following
Morton’s exoneration, the Texas Legislature unanimously passed the
Michael Morton Act. The Morton Act extends, but has not altered,
prosecutors’ longstanding obligation under <em>Brady</em> to disclose
exculpatory evidence in the prosecution’s possession. Before the Morton
Act, prosecutors had a constitutional duty under <em>Brady</em> to
disclose all evidence that might exonerate the defendant, but the
defense had very limited pretrial discovery rights. Under the Morton
Act, if the defense requests discovery, the prosecution is under a
statutory duty to continually disclose exculpatory, mitigating, or
impeachment evidence. The Act is an important legislative step towards
ensuring <em>Brady</em> compliance and bolstering the integrity of the
criminal justice system.</p>
<p>As this case sadly demonstrates, however, unacceptable gaps remain.
When one good man refuses to stay silent, refuses to “just follow
orders,” and refuses to do the wrong thing under the misguided belief
that it’s for the greater good, he should not lose his job. While
Hillman might have had a viable <em>ultra vires</em> claim, had he
chosen to pursue one, the limited remedies available under that theory
are manifestly inadequate to ensure accountability in matters of the
highest constitutional dimension. The law must—but currently does
not—afford a remedy that advances the Legislature’s calculated efforts
to secure our constitutional guarantees.</p>

<p>In 2013, Eric Hillman, an assistant district attorney in Nueces
County, was assigned to prosecute David Sims for intoxication assault
and leaving the scene of an accident. Hillman performed a diligent
independent investigation and located a witness who was not listed in
the police report. The witness told Hillman she was with Sims the entire
evening, he had only consumed two alcoholic beverages, and he was not
intoxicated when the accident occurred.</p>
<p>Hillman immediately informed his supervisor that a new witness with
exculpatory testimony had been located and he would be releasing that
information to Sims’s defense counsel. The supervisor demanded Hillman
withhold the information, assuring him it was proper to do so.</p>
<p>Unconvinced, Hillman conducted an independent investigation of his
ethical obligations, consulting with both the Texas Center for Legal
Ethics and the State Bar of Texas Ethics Hotline. Both admonished him to
disclose the information to defense counsel. Hillman therefore reported
to his supervisor that he intended to turn over the evidence to the
defense because withholding it would be unethical. According to Hillman,
his supervisor responded, “Eric, you need to decide if you want to be a
prosecutor or a defense attorney.” A week after Hillman announced his
intention to disclose the information, former District Attorney Mark
Skurka summarily terminated Hillman’s employment for refusing to “follow
instructions.”</p>
<p>Hillman sued the County, District Attorney Skurka, and the District
Attorney’s Office for wrongful termination, but his case was dismissed
on a plea to the jurisdiction.</p>
<p>I concur in today’s judgment and join in much of the Court’s
reasoning. The gravamen of this case is governmental immunity: whether
the County is immune from a wrongful-termination suit alleging a
prosecutor was fired because he insisted on doing what the law requires.
Under our immunity jurisprudence, this case is fairly straightforward,
and the Court’s analysis is sound. First, we did not abrogate
governmental immunity in <em>Sabine Pilot</em>. The employer in that
case was not a governmental entity, so the issue of governmental
immunity was not before us and cannot be inferred <em>sub silentio</em>.
Second, immunity has not been waived. We defer to the Legislature to
waive immunity, and I agree with the Court that the Morton Act contains
no such waiver because no “clear and unambiguous language” expresses
that intent. Third, we should not abrogate immunity here. Although we
have the power to abrogate immunity, we have rarely done so, and even
then we limited it to offset claims rather than allowing unlimited
recovery of monetary damages. Sanctioning the recovery of monetary
damages—without any legislatively considered limitations like those in
the Texas Tort Claims Act—would have significant public-fisc
implications that raise separation-of-powers concerns. Finally, though
Hillman arguably has a viable <em>ultra vires</em> claim, he has
disclaimed any intent to assert one. Accordingly, I agree with the Court
that the County is immune from suit in this case and that remand is not
appropriate. I write separately, however, to highlight a lacuna in the
legislative scheme that neuters the Legislature’s efforts to forestall
prosecutorial misconduct that could lead to wrongful convictions.</p>

<p>Taking Hillman’s account as true, he was fired for endeavoring to
fulfill constitutional and statutory obligations imposed on all
prosecutors. By any measure of law and morality in a civilized country,
that is wrongful termination. Those we entrust to pursue justice should
not be put to the Hobson’s choice of earning a living or doing the right
thing. Cloaking governmental employers with absolute immunity in such
circumstances erodes public confidence in the criminal justice system
and undermines concerted legislative efforts to reform that system. By
and large, prosecutors are honorable public servants committed to
fairness in the administration of justice, but when unlawful practices
are tolerated, encouraged, or rewarded with career advantages, others
may be enticed to cross the line or may be cowed by consequences visited
on those who resist. It’s fair to assume that the Legislature did not
envision such a consequence when enacting the Morton Act without
adopting measures to ensure prosecutors could comply with the Act
without losing their jobs. In light of the underbelly this case exposes,
it would be appropriate for the Legislature to do so now.</p>
<p>Both <em>Brady</em> and the Morton Act obligate prosecutors to
disclose certain types of evidence to the defense as a function of due
process and to stave off wrongful convictions by thwarting pernicious
prosecutorial practices. Wrongful convictions, as numerous studies have
shown, come at a significant cost to our society. Financial burdens on
the taxpayers accumulate through “an appeal, an appellate reversal, a
retrial, investigational efforts to trace the real offender, possible
civil lawsuits, and compensatory payments.” While we can calculate
economic losses from wrongful convictions—for example, the state has
paid more than $93 million in compensation to 101 men and women who were
wrongfully sent to prison over the past 25 years—the true cost is
immeasurable. There is simply no way to restore lost time, no reset
button that erases the financial and emotional consequences to the
wrongfully incarcerated and their families.</p>
<p>On the other side of the coin, for every innocent person that sits in
jail, a criminal roams free. Free to commit more crimes. If
DNA-exoneration cases are any kind of indicator, the societal
consequences of convicting the wrong person—however it happens—are
devastating. For example, out of 325 DNA-exoneration cases from 1989 to
2014, 68 of the true perpetrators later committed an additional 142
violent crimes—including 77 rapes, 34 homicides, and 31 other violent
crimes.</p>
<p>With such grave consequences, the best defense is a good offense. The
Morton Act is a strong foundation, but more is required to ensure that
those wielding power use it as the founders intended. Prosecutors are on
the forefront of avoiding wrongful convictions and ameliorating the
ensuing societal costs. Based on data compiled by the National Registry
of Exonerations, official misconduct ranks second among the top five
factors contributing to exonerations, leading to over half of the 2,401
(and counting) exonerations since 1989. The most common type of official
misconduct involves concealing exculpatory evidence.</p>
<p>While multiple external forces are aimed at ensuring accountability
for misconduct—including professional discipline, potential criminal
charges, and loss of elected office—this case epitomizes the limits of
existing accountability measures. Research shows professional discipline
and criminal charges are rarely imposed for prosecutorial misconduct.
Even in the rare instances when misconduct is uncovered, it usually does
not surface until after an innocent person has stayed in prison for
years, presenting time-based challenges to any investigation or
prosecution of wrongdoing. The possibility of some adverse consequence
in some future public election has even less force as a deterrent and,
more importantly, does absolutely nothing to alleviate irreparable harm
resulting from the wrong.</p>
<p><em>Brady</em> violations are difficult to uncover because, by
definition, they involve concealment of evidence in the prosecution’s
exclusive possession and control. Indeed, exposure of <em>Brady</em>
violations generally requires the prosecution’s own admission, some
“chance discovery” by the defense team, or “dumb luck.” The most
effective way to combat prosecutorial misconduct is to provide a
disincentive extrinsic to an individual prosecutor’s own moral compass.
“Ironically, the only one who can act as a check on the prosecution is
the prosecution itself.” This case places the internal dynamics within
the prosecutor’s office under a microscope. Although many district
attorney’s offices have implemented internal guidance or best practices,
when the pressure to withhold evidence comes from the top, internal
guidelines are at best a window dressing. Under circumstances like those
alleged here, it is imperative that honest prosecutors not be
punished.</p>
<p>Absent legislative action, the best someone in Hillman’s position
could hope for is to seek prospective equitable relief under an
<em>ultra vires</em> theory. An <em>ultra vires</em> claim can be
brought against a state official if the officer “acted without legal
authority.” Although a district attorney has discretion to fire
subordinates, one could argue there is no discretion to undertake such
an action if it “conflicts with the law.” If Hillman had not opposed
consideration of his claims under an <em>ultra vires</em> theory, I
would remand in the interest of justice to allow him to pursue that
claim.</p>
<p>However, as a policy matter, I am dubious that a remedy limited to
prospective equitable relief is strong enough to deter the egregious
conduct alleged here. To be effective, the remedy must be proportional
to the wrong. To my mind, the threat of other consequences, including
monetary relief, would provide the external pressure required to
motivate vigilance and self-policing. The Legislature is better suited,
and constitutionally constituted, to weigh the policy interests that
bear on whether to waive immunity (and to what extent), but as to that
matter, this case makes painfully clear that what’s past is
prologue.</p>
