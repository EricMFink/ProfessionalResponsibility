<h4>In re Advisory Opinion No. 544 of NJ Sup. Court, 511 A. 2d 609 (N.J.
1986)</h4>
<p class="case-h1">
Handler, J.
</p>
<p>We are called to consider in this case the application of
attorney-client protections to the relationship between a public legal
services organization and the individuals whom it assists. The issue
posed is whether certain information relating to the clients of a legal
services organization, which provides legal assistance to mentally
impaired or disabled and indigent persons, may be disclosed to the
private and governmental entities that provide funds to the
organization, without violating the protections of confidentiality
accorded attorney-client communications and relationships.</p>
<p>The legal services organization resisting such disclosure is the
Community Health Law Project. It is a non-profit organization providing
legal services to indigent, mentally disabled and retarded persons in
Essex, Mercer, Union, and Camden counties. Its legal services are funded
by private and public sources. Various contracts with the funding
entities obligate the Law Project to make periodic reports relating to
the services provided, including in some instances information about the
individual clients served.</p>
<p>Under the funding plans of several community mental health centers,
identifying, descriptive information, such as a client’s name, address,
and date of birth, have been sought by the entities providing funds. The
Law Project has chosen not to reveal the identity of individual clients
by furnishing such information. Rather, it has attempted to accommodate
these requests by providing data that have been aggregated and by
disclosing information on individual clients only to the extent and in a
manner that the revelation would not serve to identify the clients
directly or indirectly. However, several funding entities expressed
their dissatisfaction with the generalized nature of the information
received from the Law Project and have insisted upon obtaining
individual client-identifying information.</p>
<p>In the face of these more particularized demands, the Law Project has
taken the position that such identifying information is or may be
protected from disclosure under the strictures governing the
professional conduct of lawyers. However, confronted by this genuine
ethical dilemma, the Law Project sought guidance from the Advisory
Committee on Professional Ethics in January 1984 to ensure that
disclosure would not violate any ethical precepts.</p>
<p>In Opinion No. 544, the ACPE ruled that the disclosure of the
information requested by private and public funding entities does not
violate the confidences of the Law Project’s clients and that the
information requested would not violate client secrets or confidences
within the meaning of then-applicable ethics standards. The Law Project
then filed a petition with this Court to review the determination of the
ACPE, which was originally denied. A motion for reconsideration of the
denial was then granted by this Court.</p>
<p>We must initially consider the applicability of the attorney-client
privilege to the relationships that exist between the Law Project and
its clientele. The Law Project, as we have noted, is an organization
that provides legal services to a particular class of persons,
consisting of indigent, mentally-retarded, or disabled individuals.
These persons are in need of legal assistance but cannot otherwise
afford to retain an attorney and hence turn to the Law Project for legal
help. The Law Project engages licensed attorneys of the State, who
furnish legal advice and counselling to the individuals eligible for
such services.</p>
<p>As licensed attorneys, the Law Project’s lawyers are subject in every
respect to the rules governing the professional conduct of lawyers.
Accordingly, lawyers employed by governmental or public interest
organizations are bound by the same ethical mandates of the Supreme
Court’s Rules of Professional Conduct, as well as other standards
governing the professional activities of licensed attorneys.</p>
<p>Further, the persons who receive the legal services of the Law
Project through its individual staff attorney are “clients.” A client,
in the context of the attorney-client privilege, is a person who
“consults a lawyer for the purpose of retaining the lawyer or securing
legal service or advice from him in his professional capacity.”
Consequently, it is not questioned that there exists between the Law
Project and its attorneys who render legal services and the persons who
receive those services an attorney-client relationship to which the
attorney-client privilege fully applies.</p>
<p>It is also beyond question that indigent, needy, or otherwise
eligible clients, assisted by attorneys without fees, are entitled to
the same protections as clients who retain private counsel. Because the
status of clients in every sense is ascribed to these persons, we must
accordingly consider in this case the extent of these
client-protections, particularly as to matters falling within the ambit
of the attorney-client privilege.</p>
<p>The major focus of the attorney-client privilege has historically and
traditionally been upon the communications that occur or information
that is exchanged between an attorney and his or her client relating to
the special attorney-client relationship. The attorney-client privilege
is recognized as one of “the oldest of the privileges for confidential
communications.” While the attorney-client privilege has evolved and
changed in terms of its emphasis and applications, the primary
justification and dominant rationale for the privilege has come to be
the encouragement of free and full disclosure of information from the
client to the attorney. This has led to the recognition that the
privilege belongs to the client, rather than the attorney.</p>
<p>The extent of the protection accorded communications and other
information arising in the course of any attorney-client relationship is
governed by the attorney-client privilege as well as several ethics
standards. The attorney-client privilege itself, while rooted in the
common law, has acquired a basis in both statute and rule. This
codification provides that communications between a lawyer and his or
her client in the course of that relationship and in professional
confidence are privileged; a client has a privilege (a) to refuse to
disclose any such communication, and (b) to prevent his or her lawyer
from disclosing it. While in a sense the privilege belongs to the
client, the lawyer is obligated to claim the privilege unless otherwise
instructed by the client or the client’s representative.</p>
<p>The scope of the attorney-client privilege or protections is also
subject to ethics rules governing attorney conduct. In this case, the
ACPE determined the issue posed by the Law Project under the former
Disciplinary Rules. It applied Disciplinary Rule 4-101(A), entitled
“Preservation of Confidences and Secrets of a Client.” Under this rule,
confidences are defined as information protected by the attorney-client
privilege under applicable law. Ibid. The rule also deals with
“secrets,” which are defined as other information gained in the
professional relationship that the client has requested be held
inviolate or the disclosure of which would be embarrassing or
detrimental to the client.</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Rules have been superseded by the Rules of
Professional Conduct. The relevant rule now provides that a lawyer shall
not reveal information relating to representation of a client unless the
client consents after consultation except for disclosures that are
impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation. In
comparison to the provisions of the former Disciplinary Rule, this Rule
expands the scope of protected information to include all information
relating to the representation, regardless of the source or whether the
client has requested it be kept confidential or whether disclosure of
the information would be embarrassing or detrimental to the client.
Thus, the definition of confidential information under Rules of
Professional Conduct 1.6(a) is broader and more inclusive than that of
Disciplinary Rule 4-101(A).</p>
<p>The ethics rules generally forbid disclosure of client information,
without the client’s consent, unless one of the exceptions to the rule
is available. Disclosure of client information is permissible if the
client consents after consultation. In this case no one urges the
possible applicability of this provision dealing with consent. In
situations such as this where the clients receiving legal services are
indigent as well as mentally impaired or disabled, they may not be able
to appreciate the nature or importance of their own interests or their
ability to resist or decline consent or disclosure.</p>
<p>The appropriate analysis must therefore focus upon whether the
revelation of client information to someone other than the lawyer
amounts to the impermissible disclosure of a privileged communication or
a secret or information relating to the relationship. That inquiry is
here particularized in terms of whether certain information that
identifies the disabled and indigent persons receiving legal services
from a legal services project may be disclosed to funding sources
without violating the attorney-client privilege as defined by both
statute and the Court’s ethics strictures governing professional
conduct.</p>
<p>Arguably “information gained in the course of an attorney-client
relationship,” as provided under the former Disciplinary Rule 4-101(A),
might not include information that consists of only the identity of the
client. The thrust of this definitional standard appears to be directed
to information in the nature of communications. While a client’s
identity per se might not be necessarily considered a privileged
communication as such, in some instances disclosure of identity may
indirectly reveal other information about the client. Hence, depending
upon the nature of such additional or collateral information that is
revealed by the disclosure of a client’s identity, the need for
confidentiality could appropriately cloak even identity. In this case,
for example, disclosure of the identity of clients of the Law Project
would be tantamount to the revelation of the mental and financial status
of the individuals, as well as the fact that he or she has a legal
problem that required the services of an attorney.</p>
<p>Furthermore, under the former Disciplinary Rules, it would appear
that matters such as the identification or address of a client could
still be considered to be a “secret” entitled to non-disclosure. In
<em>Fellerman v. Bradley</em>, an attorney refused to disclose the
address of his client, thereby thwarting the enforcement of a divorce
judgment against the client. The Court concluded that this information
could be considered a confidence or in the nature of a protected secret
covered by the attorney-client privilege and the Disciplinary Rule,
holding nonetheless that, in the circumstances, the fraud exception to
the privilege applied to preclude non-disclosure of the client’s
address.</p>
<p>The dilemma posed by requests for client-identity information has
been addressed by the American Bar Association Committee on Professional
Ethics and various state advisory committees. In an opinion issued in
1969, the Committee ruled that a legal services office could allow the
accounting office to examine its intake and disposition forms provided
all identifying data were deleted. Similarly, in 1974, the Committee
determined that a legal services organization could reveal client
information to its Board of Directors if anonymity was preserved, the
information was reasonably required by the board for a legitimate
purpose, and the client expressed an informed consent.</p>
<p>The Board of Professional Responsibility of the Supreme Court of
Tennessee reached a similar result. It determined that a client’s name,
address, zip code, sex, race, age, social security number, phone number,
source of referral, and the dates representation began were all secrets
within the meaning of Disciplinary Rule 4-101 and could not be disclosed
to funding sources unless the client consented.</p>
<p>We are persuaded by the soundness of these opinions. Also highly
relevant to our analysis is the fact that client information that serves
to identify the client would clearly be protected under the current
Rules of Professional Conduct, RPC 1.6. As noted, this rule accords
confidentiality to any information relating to the representation of a
client. Manifestly this would include a client’s identity.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we hold that under current standards governing attorney
conduct, client-identity may not be disclosed to any private or public
funding agency in the absence of appropriate consent or other legal
justification. In so ruling, we determine that a client’s identity
constitutes information relating to the representation of a client under
the current Rules of Professional Conduct and a secret entitled to
non-disclosure, if not a protected confidential communication, under the
attorney-client privilege and former Disciplinary Rule 4-101(A), which
was relied upon by the ACPE in this case.</p>
<p>It is further suggested that even though this information might
otherwise be subject to a privilege against disclosure, there may be a
legal justification that would allow such disclosure. Disclosure of such
information is permissible because, it is contended, the information
sought is required to be furnished by law. The Division of Mental Health
and Hospitals has promulgated regulations requiring reporting for all
agencies receiving financial assistance through the Division, to aid in
monitoring compliance and for program planning and development. Also,
under N.J.A.C. 10:37-6.84 information such as client services and fiscal
reports are to be submitted to the Division. Further, the Divisions of
Mental Health and Hospitals and Developmental Disabilities and the
various county mental health agencies are required to maintain the
confidentiality of any client information it receives from the Law
Project. It is contended that the reporting of information is needed to
comply with these regulations and that this would not constitute either
impermissible disclosure or public disclosure of client information
violative of applicable ethics restrictions.</p>
<p>Under the Rules of Professional Conduct a lawyer may reveal such
information to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary to
comply with the law. However, the regulations promulgated by the
Division that provide for reporting as related to the persons assisted
by the Law Project do not specifically require client-identifying
information. Moreover, there is no legal requirement that
client-identifying information be disclosed to private funding agencies.
In the absence of such requirements, we may not infer that this
client-identifying information is necessary to be disclosed as a matter
of law. Hence, it may remain privileged under the Rules of Professional
Conduct.</p>
<p>This result, we point out, would not be different under the former
ethics rules. In <em>Fellerman v. Bradley</em>, the compliance-with-law
exception of Disciplinary Rule 4-101(C)(3), was deemed to prohibit
disclosure of attorney-client information except in a situation in which
the client was attempting through non-disclosure to evade an order of a
court. We expressed the view that the policies underlying the privilege
would not be advanced by allowing the client through his attorney to
perpetrate a fraud on the court or to thwart justice by consenting to
and subsequently ignoring a judgment of the court by refusing to
disclose the client’s address.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that if by statute or valid rule or regulation
information concerning the identity of clients of a legal services
organization were clearly required to be reported for legitimate
governmental purposes, the analysis and result could well be different.
A different conclusion as to the propriety of disclosure might also
obtain in the event private funding sources sought client information
under enforceable rules or regulations. It can reasonably be assumed
that in such a context, the welfare and interests of clients would
remain a paramount concern and that the disclosure occasioned by such
necessary reporting would be attended by suitable protections reflecting
needs for confidentiality and privacy.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
II.
</p>
<p>We conclude that client-identifying data with respect to persons
receiving legal assistance through the Law Project constitute matters
clearly covered by the Rules of Professional Conduct as “information
relating to representation.” Such material is also covered under the
attorney-client privilege and the former Disciplinary Rule as
information in the nature of client secrets that could be embarrassing
or detrimental to the client if revealed. Under these strictures we are
satisfied that it would be improper to reveal such information to either
public or private funding sources in the absence of valid consent or
reasonable rules clearly requiring such disclosure for legitimate
purposes.</p>

<h4>Dougherty v. Pepper Hamilton LLP, 133 A. 3d 792 (Pa. Super. Ct.
2016)</h4>
<p class="case-h1">
Shogan, J.
</p>
<p>Appellant, John J. Dougherty, appeals from the order granting summary
judgment in favor of Pepper Hamilton LLP and its attorneys Amy B.
Ginensky, Michael E. Baughman, Peter M. Smith, and Raphael Cunniff, in
this civil action alleging breach of fiduciary duty and breach of
contract. For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand for further
proceedings.</p>
<p>We summarize the protracted history of this case as follows. On
October 30, 2003, Appellant retained Pepper Hamilton to represent him in
relation to a federal matter involving a grand jury subpoena he
received. Although Appellant was not the target of the grand jury
investigation, an FBI Affidavit was filed to secure a search of
Appellant’s residence. Appellant has alleged that he provided Pepper
Hamilton unfettered access to documents during the firm’s representation
of Appellant. Also, counsel from Pepper Hamilton was present during the
execution of the search warrant at Appellant’s home in November of
2006.</p>
<p>Initially, the FBI Affidavit securing the search warrant was under
seal, but, somehow, the FBI Affidavit inadvertently became attached to a
document presented in an unrelated criminal matter involving an
unrelated person named “Donald Dougherty, Jr.” According to Appellant,
on January 30, 2008, the federal government filed a response to Donald
Dougherty Jr.’s motion to suppress evidence, which was entered as
Document No. 27 on the federal criminal docket for the prosecution of
Donald Dougherty, Jr. This filing was allegedly made under “restricted
status.”2 Document No. 27 referenced, as Exhibit “A,” a copy of an
affidavit by an FBI agent in support of the issuance of a search warrant
for Donald Dougherty, Jr.’s premises. However, the affidavit that was
attached to Document No. 27 as Exhibit “A” was actually the FBI
Affidavit in support of the search of Appellant’s premises.</p>
<p>At least some of the documents in Donald Dougherty Jr.’s case were
filed under seal and, thus, not accessible to the public. Subsequently,
however, in April of 2008, certain documents in Donald Dougherty Jr.’s
case were unsealed by Judge Robreno of the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. More specifically, Judge
Robreno’s April 11, 2008 order authorized the eastern district Clerk of
Court to lift the seal on Documents 31, 32, 48 and 38. Appellant alleges
that Document No. 27 was also, albeit mistakenly, removed from
“restrictive status” around this time.</p>
<p>When Appellant was running for a vacant seat in the Pennsylvania
Senate in April of 2008, the Philadelphia Inquirer published several
articles about Appellant. The articles implied that Appellant had
engaged in criminal conduct in the past and was likely to do so again if
elected to the Pennsylvania Senate. In March of 2009, Appellant
initiated a defamation suit against the Inquirer in state court. In
2011, Pepper Hamilton assumed representation of the defense for the
Inquirer in the defamation suit filed by Appellant. In 2012, Pepper
Hamilton informed the trial court that the defense of the defamation
action would rely on information relating to the federal investigation
in which Pepper Hamilton had previously represented Appellant. In 2013,
Appellant moved to have Pepper Hamilton removed as defense counsel in
his defamation action against the Inquirer. The trial court denied the
motion to disqualify Pepper Hamilton. On appeal this Court reversed the
decision of the trial court and remanded the matter for the entry of an
order barring Pepper Hamilton and its attorneys from representing the
Inquirer.</p>
<p>On December 10, 2012, while Pepper Hamilton and its attorneys were
still representing the Inquirer, the firm filed a motion for summary
judgment in the defamation suit and included in the attached exhibits a
copy of the FBI Affidavit. On December 12, 2012, the Inquirer then
published a front-page article, which included detailed references to
the FBI Affidavit.</p>
<p>On February 11, 2013, Appellant initiated the instant action by
filing a complaint against Appellees alleging breach of fiduciary duty
and breach of contract. Appellant alleged that, in representing the
Inquirer in the defamation suit, Pepper Hamilton acted against the
interests of Appellant, its former client. The trial court has
summarized the subsequent procedural history of this case as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Appellees filed Preliminary Objections on April 3, 2013. These
Preliminary Objections were overruled by this Court by Order dated June
18, 2013. An Answer was filed by Appellees on July 8, 2013. On May 27,
2014, after some discovery was conducted and a Revised Case Management
Order entered, Appellees filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. An Answer
in response to the Motion for Summary Judgment was filed by Appellant on
June 27, 2014. A Reply in Support of the Motion for Summary Judgment was
filed by Appellees on July 2, 2014. A Supplemental Memorandum in Support
of the Motion for Summary Judgment was filed by Appellees on July 25,
2014, and a Supplemental Memorandum in Opposition was filed by Appellant
on July 29, 2014. By Order dated July 29, 2014, and entered on the
docket on July 30, 2014, Summary Judgment was granted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This timely appeal followed.</p>
<p>Appellant presents the following issues for our review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A. Whether the Trial Court erred in granting Appellees’ motion for
summary judgment on the mistaken basis that, because Pepper’s breach of
fiduciary duty was also a violation of the Pennsylvania Rules of
Professional Conduct, Appellant cannot assert a claim against Pepper as
a matter of law. B. Whether the Trial Court erred in holding that
Appellees were entitled to summary judgment because, although they used
information against Appellant that is substantially related to their
former representation of him, that information is publicly available and
thus cannot form the basis of a disloyalty claim. C. Whether the Trial
Court prematurely granted Appellees motion for summary judgment where
the parties had exchanged limited written discovery and taken no
depositions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each of Appellant’s issues challenges the propriety of the trial
court’s determination granting summary judgment.</p>
<p>A legal malpractice claim based on breach of contract, “involves (1)
the existence of a contract, (2) a breach of a duty imposed by the
contract, and (3) damages.” With respect to a legal malpractice claim
based on breach of contract, this Court has stated the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The attorney’s liability must be assessed under the terms of the
contract. Thus, if the attorney agrees to provide her best efforts and
fails to do so, an action in assumpsit will accrue. An attorney who
agrees for a fee to represent a client is by implication agreeing to
provide that client with professional services consistent with those
expected of the profession at large.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With respect to a breach of fiduciary duty claim, “a confidential
relationship and the resulting fiduciary duty may attach wherever one
occupies toward another such a position of advisor or counsellor as
reasonably to inspire confidence that he will act in good faith for the
other’s interest.” The leading case in Pennsylvania discussing breach of
a fiduciary duty by an attorney with regard to a conflict of interest is
<em>Maritrans GP Inc. v. Pepper, Hamilton &amp; Scheetz</em>. In
<em>Maritrans</em>, our Supreme Court upheld the trial court’s issuance
of a preliminary injunction preventing Pepper Hamilton from representing
its former clients’ competitors. The Court found that a cause of action
for breach of a fiduciary duty against a law firm was actionable where
the firm acquired confidential information during the course of its
representation. In discussing actionability for breach of a fiduciary
duty, our Supreme Court reiterated the following long-standing
principles:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Activity is actionable if it constitutes breach of a duty imposed by
statute or by common law. Our common law imposes on attorneys the status
of fiduciaries vis a vis their clients; that is, attorneys are bound, at
law, to perform their fiduciary duties properly. Failure to so perform
gives rise to a cause of action. It is “actionable.” At common law, an
attorney owes a fiduciary duty to his client; such duty demands
undivided loyalty and prohibits the attorney from engaging in conflicts
of interest, and breach of such duty is actionable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>Maritrans</em> Court highlighted that Pepper Hamilton “was
furnished with substantial confidential commercial information” and
“came to know the complete inner-workings of the company along with
Maritrans’ longterm objectives, and competitive strategies.” As
explained by the Court, adherence to a fiduciary duty “ensures that
clients will feel secure that everything they discuss with counsel will
be kept in confidence” and that Pepper Hamilton “had a duty to
administer properly their responsibilities to respect the confidences of
Maritrans.” It further explained that the rationale behind this policy
is to prevent an attorney from taking “undue advantage of the
confidential communications of such client.”</p>
<p>In reaching its determination, the Court in <em>Maritrans</em>
emphasized the confidential information that Pepper Hamilton garnered
during the course of its representations.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Rule of Professional Conduct 1.9 further addresses
attorney duties to former clients and provides, in relevant part, as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) A lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter shall
not thereafter represent another person in the same or a substantially
related matter in which that person’s interests are materially adverse
to the interests of the former client unless the former client gives
informed consent. (c) A lawyer who has formerly represented a client in
a matter or whose present or former firm has formerly represented a
client in a matter shall not thereafter: (1) use information relating to
the representation to the disadvantage of the former client except as
these Rules would permit or require with respect to a client, or when
the information has become generally known; or (2) reveal information
relating to the representation except as these Rules would permit or
require with respect to a client.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The explanatory comment to Rule 1.9(c) offers the following pertinent
insight:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>8 Paragraph (c) provides that information acquired by the lawyer in
the course of representing a client may not subsequently be used or
revealed by the lawyer to the disadvantage of the client. However, the
fact that a lawyer has once served a client does not preclude the lawyer
from using generally known information about that client when later
representing another client.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, section 59 of the Restatement (Third) of the Law
Governing Lawyers defines the term “Confidential Client Information” as
“Confidential client information consists of information relating to
representation of a client, other than information that is generally
known.” Comment b to the above definition explains that “the definition
includes information that becomes known by others, so long as the
information does not become generally known.” Furthermore, comment d
states the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4" type="a">
<li>
<em>Generally known information</em>. Confidential client
information does not include information that is generally known. Such
information may be employed by a lawyer who possesses it in permissibly
representing other clients and in other contexts where there is a
specific justification for doing so. Information might be generally
known at the time it is conveyed to the lawyer or might become generally
known thereafter. At the same time, the fact that information has become
known to some others does not deprive it of protection if it has not
become generally known in the relevant sector of the public. Whether
information is generally known depends on all circumstances relevant in
obtaining the information. Information contained in books or records in
public libraries, public-record depositaries such as government offices,
or in publicly accessible electronic-data storage is generally known if
the particular information is obtainable through publicly available
indexes and similar methods of access. Information is not generally
known when a person interested in knowing the information could obtain
it only by means of special knowledge or substantial difficulty or
expense. Special knowledge includes information about the whereabouts or
identity of a person or other source from which the information can be
acquired, if those facts are not themselves generally known. A lawyer
may not justify adverse use or disclosure of client information simply
because the information has become known to third persons, if it is not
otherwise generally known. Moreover, if a current client specifically
requests that information of any kind not be used or disclosed in ways
otherwise permissible, the lawyer must either honor that request or
withdraw from the representation.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>We further observe that there is no Pennsylvania case law directly on
point. However, as the Supreme Court of Ohio aptly stated in <em>Akron
Bar Association v. Holder</em>, “An attorney is not free to disclose
embarrassing or harmful features of a client’s life just because they
are documented in public records or the attorney learned of them in some
other way.” Likewise, in <em>Lawyer Disciplinary Board v. McGraw</em>,
the Supreme Court of West Virginia observed that “the ethical duty of
confidentiality is not nullified by the fact that the information is
part of a public record or by the fact that someone else is privy to
it.”</p>
<p>Here, the trial court concluded that because the FBI Affidavit was
inadvertently appended to a document in an unrelated criminal matter,
the information contained therein was public. Specifically, the trial
court stated that “the fact that the FBI Affidavit in question was
publicly available for many years precludes a determination that the
receipt of the improperly filed FBI Affidavit through a breach by
Appellees of the attorney-client relationship and duty of fidelity is
actionable.”</p>
<p>Our review of the record, in the light most favorable to Appellant as
the non-moving party, reflects that the trial court erred in granting
summary judgment in this case. Indeed, this case presents genuine issues
of fact. The record reveals that the FBI Affidavit in question became
part of another criminal matter through inadvertence. Even accepting
that the FBI Affidavit was publicly available through PACER prior to
December 10, 2012, we are left to ponder whether the FBI Affidavit was
actually “generally known.” All that is acknowledged at this point in
the proceedings is that the FBI Affidavit was inadvertently appended to
a document in a case that did not involve Appellant as a party.
Therefore, it appears that such document was not “indexed” under
Appellant’s name and that a person interested in the FBI Affidavit
“could obtain it only by means of special knowledge.” Furthermore, it is
unknown exactly how and when the FBI Affidavit came into the possession
of the Inquirer and eventually became the subject of an article in the
Inquirer during Pepper Hamilton’s representation of the Inquirer.
Whether Pepper Hamilton committed a breach of its duties to Appellant
depends on the answers to these questions. Thus, these questions are
sufficient to establish genuine issues of material fact regarding Pepper
Hamilton’s conduct. Contrary to the trial court’s conclusion, in the
event that the FBI Affidavit was not generally known information, it
appears that Pepper Hamilton breached its duty to Appellant as a former
client and such breach was actionable. Accordingly, we reverse the order
granting summary judgment.</p>

<h4>Matter of Tennant, 392 P. 3d 143 (Mont. 2017)</h4>
<p class="case-h1">
Justice Beth Baker delivered the Opinion and Order of the Court.
</p>
<p>These consolidated proceedings include two formal disciplinary
complaints filed against Montana attorney David G. Tennant. The
complaints, which arise from Tennant’s debt collection practices against
clients and former clients, will be referenced in this Opinion and Order
as the Ray complaint and the Harshman complaint.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
Background
</p>
<p>Tennant represented Richard and Debbie Harshman in an action for
eviction of tenants from, and possession of, real property in Hungry
Horse, Montana. The Harshmans obtained a default judgment against their
tenants for damages to the property, including attorney fees of
$3,063.54. When he was unable to collect the attorney fees through
execution on the tenants and the Harshmans did not pay their bill to
Tennant’s firm, Tennant filed an attorney’s lien on the property. He
later filed a complaint against the Harshmans alleging breach of
contract, account stated, and foreclosure of the attorney’s lien, in
which action he was granted a default judgment of $8,148.68. Tennant
assigned the judgment to a collection agency, which obtained a writ of
execution on the Harshmans’ property. A sheriff’s sale was held, at
which the collection agency was the successful bidder. The Harshmans
later redeemed their property.</p>
<p>Both Ray and the Harshmans filed complaints against Tennant with the
Office of Disciplinary Counsel, and ODC filed formal disciplinary
complaints in both matters. On August 31, 2016, Tennant filed
conditional admissions and an affidavit of consent to discipline in
these consolidated proceedings, pursuant to Rule 26, Montana Rules for
Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement. ODC objected to Tennant’s conditional
admissions. On October 20, 2016, the Commission on Practice held a
hearing on the complaints and to consider Tennant’s conditional
admissions. Tennant was present with counsel and testified on his own
behalf.</p>
<p>On January 5, 2017, the Commission submitted to this Court its
Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Recommendation for Discipline.
The Commission rejected Tennant’s conditional admissions. The Commission
concluded that ODC failed to carry its burden of proving by clear and
convincing evidence any MRPC violations alleged in the Harshman
complaint.</p>
<p>The Commission recommends that, as a result of his violations of the
Montana Rules of Professional Conduct, Tennant be disciplined by public
censure by this Court. The Commission recommends that, in the future,
Tennant be required to provide to clients and former clients copies of
any attorney’s liens he or his firm files against them. In addition, the
Commission recommends that, for a period of three years, Tennant be
required to provide to ODC copies of any attorney’s liens filed by him
or his firm, copies of all complaints filed by him or his firm and
served against former clients for unpaid fees, and copies of judgments
or assignments of judgments obtained by him or his firm against former
clients.</p>
<p>ODC has filed written objections to the Commission’s findings,
conclusions, and recommendation, and Tennant has filed a response.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
Discussion
</p>
<p>ODC argues that the Commission erred in concluding that it failed to
prove violation of Rule 1.9, MRPC, in relation to the Harshmans. Rule
1.9(c) provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter or whose
present or former firm has formerly represented a client in a matter
shall not thereafter: (1) use information relating to the representation
to the disadvantage of the former client except as these Rules would
permit or require with respect to a client, or when the information has
become generally known.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ODC alleged Tennant violated this Rule when he bid on the Harshmans’
Hungry Horse property at the sheriff’s sale, because Tennant’s knowledge
of the property derived from his representation of the Harshmans. The
Commission determined that because Tennant could have found out that the
Harshmans owned property in Hungry Horse via public record and then
foreclosed his fee lien and bid at the sheriff’s sale, no violation of
Rule 1.9 occurred.</p>
<p>As ODC emphasizes, Rule 1.9’s language requires that, in order for
the attorney to be free from the prohibition against using
representation-related information to the disadvantage of a former
client, the information at issue must be “generally known.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether information is generally known depends on all circumstances
relevant in obtaining the information. Information contained in books or
records in public libraries, public-record depositories such as
government offices, or in publicly accessible electronic-data storage is
generally known if the particular information is obtainable through
publicly available indexes and similar methods of access. Information is
not generally known when a person interested in knowing the information
could obtain it only by means of special knowledge or substantial
difficulty or expense. A lawyer may not justify adverse use or
disclosure of client information simply because the information has
become known to third persons, if it is not otherwise generally
known.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some courts have applied a strict definition of “generally known” in
the context of a Rule 1.9 analysis. That the information at issue is
generally available does not suffice; the information must be within the
basic understanding and knowledge of the public. “The client’s privilege
in confidential information disclosed to his attorney is not nullified
by the fact that the circumstances to be disclosed are part of a public
record, or that there are other available sources for such information,
or by the fact that the lawyer received the same information from other
sources.”</p>
<p>In this case, although it would have been possible for Tennant to
discover the existence of the Harshmans’ property through searches of
public records, he undisputedly learned of the property as part of his
representation of the Harshmans. Tennant used that information to the
Harshmans’ disadvantage. We will not interpret the “generally known”
provision of Rule 1.9(c) to allow Tennant to take advantage of his
former clients by retroactively relying on public records of their
information for self-dealing. The Commission erred in concluding that
Tennant did not violate Rule 1.9, MRPC.</p>
<p>ODC further claims that, absent the Harshmans’ redemption of their
property, Tennant would have exceeded his fee claim and lien by
receiving a windfall from the sheriff’s sale of upwards of $80,000—his
former clients’ equity in their property. ODC submits that this is a
clear violation of Rule 1.9(c), MRPC. However, the Harshmans did redeem
their property, and ODC’s assumptions do not satisfy its burden of
proof.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
Sanctions
</p>
<p>Finally, ODC argues that the Commission’s recommended sanctions are
inadequate given Tennant’s unethical conduct and will not deter the same
type of conduct by other Montana attorneys. ODC had recommended that
Tennant be suspended from the practice of law for at least seven months
and that he be required to retake and pass the Multistate Professional
Responsibility Exam.</p>
<p>We have concluded that ODC established one ethical violation in
addition to those recognized by the Commission. However, that violation
ultimately did not harm Tennant’s clients—the Harshmans redeemed their
property. Further, the additional violation does not undermine the
Commission’s overall conclusions on the evidence presented, and on this
record we are not inclined to deviate from the discipline recommended by
the Commission.</p>

<h2>Permitted Disclosures</h2>

<h4>In re Original Grand Jury Investigation, 89 Ohio St. 3d 544 (Ohio
2000)</h4>
<p class="case-h1">
Francis E. Sweeny, Sr., J.
</p>
<p>The issue presented in this case is whether an attorney can be
compelled to disclose to the grand jury a letter written by a client and
discovered by an investigator that contains evidence of a possible crime
or whether the Ohio Code of Professional Responsibility prohibits such
disclosure.</p>
<p>At the outset, we understand that appellant was faced with an ethical
dilemma and had the difficult decision of determining how to respond to
the competing challenges of maintaining client confidentiality and
preserving the safety concerns of the public. We appreciate that
appellant confronted the problem head-on by first asking the Secretary
of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline of the
Supreme Court for advice on whether he had an obligation to report a
possible crime and then by heeding that advice by reporting the matter
to the court and cooperating with the police. Nevertheless, for the
reasons that follow, we find that appellant must comply with the grand
jury subpoena and relinquish the letter in question.</p>
<p>The concept of client confidentiality, including the attorney’s
ethical obligations concerning confidentiality, is embodied in DR 4-101.
DR 4-101(A) defines the terms “confidence” and “secret” as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Confidence” refers to information protected by the attorney-client
privilege under applicable law and “secret” refers to other information
gained in the professional relationship that the client has requested to
be held inviolate or the disclosure of which would be embarrassing or
would be likely detrimental to the client.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DR 4-101(B) states, “Except when permitted under DR 4-101(C), a
lawyer shall not knowingly reveal a confidence or secret of a
client.”</p>
<p>We must first determine whether the letter sought falls within the
definition of a client “secret.” Unlike “confidence,” which is limited
to information an attorney obtains directly from his or her client, the
term “secret” is defined in broad terms. Therefore, a client secret
includes information obtained from third-party sources, including
“information obtained by a lawyer from witnesses, by personal
investigation, or by an investigation of an agent of the lawyer,
disclosure of which would be embarrassing or harmful to the client.”</p>
<p>The court of appeals found that the letter was not a secret because
it was not information gained in the professional relationship. Instead,
the court said that the letter was simply physical evidence, which
needed to be disclosed to the authorities. Even though the letter does
constitute physical evidence of a possible crime, it also contains
information detrimental to appellant. Thus, we find that the letter
falls within the definition of a client “secret,” since it was obtained
in the professional attorney-client relationship, by appellant’s agent
(the investigator), and since it contains detrimental information
detailing a possible crime committed by appellant’s former client.</p>
<p>Although the letter is a client secret, this does not necessarily
mean that disclosure of the letter is absolutely prohibited. An attorney
may disclose a client secret if one of the four listed exceptions in DR
4-101(C) applies.</p>
<p>Appellant concedes that DR 4-101(C)(3) permits him to “reveal the
intention of his client to commit a crime and the information necessary
to prevent the crime.”3 Nevertheless, appellant contends that this
provision is narrow in its scope and permits him to orally disclose the
information contained in the letter, but does not permit him to disclose
the physical evidence (the letter). Therefore, appellant maintains that
DR 4-101(C)(3) did not permit him to reveal more than he did when he
orally disclosed the intention of his former client to commit a crime
and prevented a crime from occurring.</p>
<p>We agree with appellant that he was authorized by DR 4-101(C)(3) when
he chose to reveal the intent of his client to commit a crime, and,
actually, went beyond what DR 4-101(C)(3) allows by reading the entire
letter to the trial court and police. However, the fact that he revealed
this information does not answer the question whether he is obligated to
produce the letter itself. Thus, the question that remains is whether
appellant is required to relinquish the letter itself and present it to
the grand jury. We find that the exception found in DR 4-102(C)(2)
governs disposition of this issue.</p>
<p>DR 4-101(C)(2) provides that an attorney may reveal “confidences or
secrets when permitted under Disciplinary Rules or required by law or
court order.” Although the language contained in DR 4-101(C)(2), like
that of DR 4-101(C)(3), is written in permissive terms, courts have
interpreted provisions similar to DR 4-101(C)(2) in such a manner as to
require disclosure. The exception of DR 4-101(C)(2) for disclosures
required by law has been construed so that “the effect of other rules
compels disclosures.” Consequently, if a lawyer is “required by law” to
disclose information to the authorities, “these legal obligations create
‘forced’ exceptions to confidentiality.” Under these circumstances, a
lawyer’s duty “not to use or disclose confidential client information is
superseded when the law specifically requires such use or
disclosure.”</p>
<p>The exception of DR 4-101(C)(2) for disclosures required by law has
been applied in the context of mandating that attorneys relinquish
evidence and instrumentalities of crime to law-enforcement agencies.
Thus, the rule has emerged that, despite any confidentiality concerns, a
criminal defense attorney must produce real evidence obtained from his
or her client or from a third-party source, regardless of whether the
evidence is mere evidence of a client’s crime, or is a fruit or
instrumentality of a crime. In either event, the physical evidence must
be turned over to the proper authorities. In essence, the
confidentiality rules do not give an attorney the right to withhold
evidence.</p>
<p>Appellant contends, however, that there are strong policy reasons
against mandating disclosure. Appellant believes that mandatory
disclosure will discourage attorneys from reporting possible threats
made by their clients and will therefore run contrary to the intent of
the code, which is to prevent crimes from occurring. Appellant cites the
Massachusetts decision of <em>Purcell v. Dist. Atty. for Suffolk
Dist.</em>, which highlights these concerns.</p>
<p>In <em>Purcell</em>, an attorney informed police about his client’s
intention to commit arson. The trial court ordered the attorney to
testify about the conversation he had with his client concerning his
client’s intention to commit this crime, and the state defended the
order on the basis of the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client
privilege. The Massachusetts Supreme Court vacated the trial court’s
order and held that the attorney did not have to testify against his
client. In so holding, the court noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We must be cautious in permitting the use of client communications
that a lawyer has revealed only because of a threat to others. Lawyers
will be reluctant to come forward if they know that the information that
they disclose may lead to adverse consequences to their clients. A
practice of the use of such disclosures might prompt a lawyer to warn a
client in advance that the disclosure of certain information may not be
held in confidence, thereby chilling free discourse between lawyer and
client and reducing the prospect that the lawyer will learn of a serious
threat to the well-being of others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although these may be valid concerns, we find that the
<em>Purcell</em> decision is distinguishable from the instant case, and
that the policy reasons cited in <em>Purcell</em> have less validity
here. <em>Purcell</em> involved direct communications between an
attorney and client. The issue in that case was whether the attorney was
required to testify against his client. In this case, the
attorney-client privilege is not at issue. Nor is appellant being asked
to testify against his former client. Instead, the instant case revolves
around whether a physical piece of evidence must be relinquished to the
grand jury. While we recognize the importance of maintaining a client’s
confidences and secrets and understand that an attorney may have
concerns in turning over incriminating evidence against his or her
client, we do not believe that these concerns should override the public
interest in maintaining public safety and promoting the administration
of justice by prosecuting individuals for their alleged criminal
activity.</p>
<p>Since the letter sought in this case contains evidence of a possible
crime, we find that the letter must be turned over to the grand jury.
Accordingly, we hold that where an attorney receives physical evidence
from a third party relating to a possible crime committed by his or her
client, the attorney is obligated to relinquish that evidence to
law-enforcement authorities and must comply with a subpoena issued to
that effect.</p>
<p>Other provisions of the code support our holding that appellant must
relinquish the letter to the grand jury. DR 7-109(A) provides, “A lawyer
shall not suppress any evidence that he or his client has a legal
obligation to reveal or produce.” Furthermore, DR 7-102(A)(3) provides,
“In his representation of a client, a lawyer shall not conceal or
knowingly fail to disclose that which he is required by law to reveal.”
Reading these rules together, we believe that under the facts presented
in this case, appellant has a legal obligation to turn the letter over
to the grand jury.</p>
<p>We agree with the court of appeals that the sanction imposed against
appellant stemming from the contempt proceedings should be vacated,
given that appellant challenged the subpoena on confidentiality grounds
in good faith. Under these circumstances, we do not believe appellant
should be punished and held in contempt. The finding of contempt is
vacated on condition that appellant comply with the subpoena.
Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and order
appellant to relinquish the letter in question to the grand jury.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
PFEIFER, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part.
</p>
<p>I agree with the majority that the letter is a client secret and that
Helmick was authorized to reveal the intent of his client to commit a
crime. DR 4-101(C)(3). Revealing “the information necessary to prevent
the crime” should have concluded the matter. Unfortunately, the trial
court and now a majority of this court chose to read DR 4-101(C)(2)
liberally. That reading of the exception swallows the rule of DR
4-101(B)(1), which states that a lawyer “shall not knowingly reveal a
confidence or secret of his client,” and declares open season on defense
attorney files.</p>
<p>The majority relies on cases from other jurisdictions in which
attorneys were required to turn over to the proper authorities the
fruits and instrumentalities, including a gun, of crime. Those cases are
not similar factually to this case. <em>Purcell</em> is, and we should
have taken a similarly cautious approach. Otherwise, “lawyers will be
reluctant to come forward if they know that the information that they
disclose may lead to adverse consequences to their clients, thereby
chilling free discourse between lawyer and client and reducing the
prospect that the lawyer will learn of a serious threat to the
well-being of others.”</p>
<p>Helmick acted the way all attorneys with an ethical dilemma should:
he sought out competent counsel and followed the advice given. He acted
in a manner designed to prevent the commission of a crime, which is what
the (C)(3) exception to DR 4-101 is all about.</p>
<p>Today’s opinion will likely have two unfortunate results. First,
overzealous prosecutors will be more likely to engage in fishing
expeditions. Second, attorneys and their clients will be less likely to
discuss potential crimes, which will decrease the likelihood that the
crimes can be prevented. I concur in part and dissent in part.</p>

A. Offense, Arrest and Conviction
</p>
<p>On Tuesday, April 24, 1984, the body of Carol Jones was found in her
home in Grants Pass, Oregon. She had been struck numerous times on the
head, arms and hands with a blunt object. A gun cabinet in the home had
been forced open and a .44 caliber revolver was missing. Two of Jones’
children—Michael, age 14, and Tanya, age 10—were also missing. The
fingerprints of Robert McClure, a friend of Jones, were found in the
blood in the home. On Saturday, April 28, McClure was arrested in
connection with the death of Carol Jones and the disappearance of the
children.</p>
<p>That same day, McClure’s mother contacted attorney Christopher Mecca
and asked him to represent her son. As discussed in more detail below,
sometime in the next three days, under circumstances described
differently by McClure and Mecca, McClure revealed to Mecca the separate
remote locations where the children could be found. On Tuesday, May 1,
Mecca, armed with a map produced during his conversations with McClure,
arranged for his secretary to place an anonymous phone call to a
sheriff’s department telephone number belonging to a law enforcement
officer with whom Mecca had met earlier.</p>
<p>Later that day and the following day, sheriff’s deputies located the
children’s bodies, which were in locations more than 60 miles apart. The
children had each died from a single gunshot wound to the head. Mecca
then withdrew from representation. On May 3, McClure was indicted for
the murders of Carol Jones and her children. At trial, the prosecution
produced extensive evidence that stemmed from the discovery of the
children’s bodies and introduced testimony regarding the anonymous phone
call. McClure was found guilty of all three murders and was sentenced to
three consecutive life sentences with 30-year minimums. On direct
appeal, his conviction was affirmed without opinion.</p>
<p class="case-h2">
B. Disclosure of the Children’s Whereabouts
</p>
<p>The parties agree that Mecca and McClure met at the jail and spoke on
the telephone on a number of occasions between April 28 and May 1.
However, the substance of the conversations between McClure and Mecca
are the subject of significant dispute.</p>
<p>Mecca recorded his account in notes that he wrote immediately after
the children’s bodies were discovered. Mecca also gave deposition
testimony for McClure’s state post conviction proceeding, submitted an
affidavit prior to McClure’s federal habeas proceeding, and gave
testimony at the federal district court evidentiary hearing in the
habeas proceeding. In his notes, Mecca wrote that McClure had initially
claimed that he was “being framed” for the murder, but that he was
nervous about his fingerprints being in the house. He had asked Mecca to
help him remove some other potential evidence, which Mecca declined to
do.</p>
<p>According to the notes, on the Sunday night after McClure’s Saturday
arrest, Mecca received a “frantic phone call” from McClure’s sister, who
was convinced that McClure had murdered Jones, but had reason to believe
that the children were alive and perhaps “tied up or bound someplace.”
In response, Mecca set up a meeting with McClure, his sister and his
mother at the jail, at which McClure’s sister “directly confronted
McClure and begged him to divulge information about the whereabouts of
the kids.” McClure and his sister discussed how McClure sometimes did
“crazy things” when he was using drugs, but McClure strongly maintained
his innocence as to Carol Jones’ murder and the children’s
disappearance.</p>
<p>According to his notes, when Mecca next spoke with McClure on Monday,
McClure was less adamant in his denial. Mecca described how, when they
met on Monday afternoon, McClure began to tell him of his “sexual
hallucinations and fantasies” involving young girls and about “other
situations that happened in the past involving things he would do while
under the influence of drugs.” “It was at that time,” Mecca wrote, “when
I realized in my own mind that he had committed the crime and the
problem regarding the children intensified.” Mecca wrote that he “was
extremely agitated over the fact that these children might still be
alive.”</p>
<p>After a Monday night visit to the crime scene, Mecca returned to the
jail to speak with McClure again, at which time he “peeled off most of
the outer layers of McClure and realized that there was no doubt in my
mind that he had killed Carol Jones.” McClure told Mecca he wanted to
see a psychiatrist, then launched into “bizarre ramblings.” “Each time
as I would try to leave,” Mecca recalled in his notes, “McClure would
spew out other information, bits about the children, and he would do it
in the form of a fantasy.” Mecca wrote that he “wanted to learn from him
what happened to those children.” He told McClure “that we all have
hiding places, that we all know when we go hiking or driving or
something, we all remember certain back roads and remote places,” and
that McClure “related to me one place where a body might be” and then
“described where the other body would be located.” Mecca wrote that he
“wasn’t going to push him for anything more,” but “when I tried to
leave, he said, and he said it tentatively, ‘would you like me to draw
you a map and just give you an idea?’ and I said ‘Yes’ and he did.”
Mecca recorded that “at that time, I felt in my own mind the children
were dead, but, of course, I wasn’t sure.”</p>
<p>Very late on Monday evening, McClure telephoned Mecca at home and
said, “I know who did it.” Mecca recorded in his notes that the next
morning he went to meet with McClure, and asked him about this
statement. McClure told Mecca that “Satan killed Carol.” When Mecca
asked, “What about the kids?” McClure replied, “Jesus saved the kids.”
Mecca wrote in his notes that this statement “hit me so abruptly, I
immediately assumed that if Jesus saved the kids, that the kids are
alive.” Mecca wrote that he “kind of felt that McClure was talking about
a sexual thing, but, in any event, I wasn’t sure.”</p>
<p>Mecca’s notes indicate that on Monday, before McClure made the “Jesus
saved the kids” comment, and again on Tuesday, immediately after the
meeting at which he made that comment, Mecca had conversations with
fellow lawyers, seeking advice regarding “the dilemma that he faced.”
After the second of these conversations, which took place Tuesday
morning, Mecca arranged for a noon meeting with the undersheriff and the
prosecutor. At the meeting, he “mentioned to them that I may have
information which would be of interest to the State” and attempted to
negotiate a plea. When the prosecutor responded that there would be no
deal, Mecca recorded in his notes, “I had made up my mind then that I
had to do the correct thing. The only option I had, as far as I was
concerned, was to disclose the whereabouts of the bodies.” (Recall that
by the time Mecca wrote these notes, he had learned that the children
were dead.) A law enforcement official testified in a federal court
deposition that, after both the state bar association and the attorney
general “recommended that it would be unwise for Mr. Mecca to provide us
information,” Mecca “indicated that, even though there might be
sanctions, that he still was wanting to provide information that he had
regarding the children.” Mecca stated that when he spoke with McClure’s
sister and mother, they were adamant that he do whatever he could to
locate the children, and that “they were still under the impression that
one or both of the children were alive, or at least there was a chance
they were alive.”</p>
<p>Mecca then returned to the jail Tuesday afternoon and, according to
his notes, “advised McClure that if there was any possibility that these
children were alive, we were obligated to disclose that information in
order to prevent, if possible, the occurrence of what could be the
elevation of an assault to a murder, for instance. I further indicated
that if he really requested psychiatric help, to help him deal with his
problem, that this perhaps was the first step.” “In any event,” Mecca
recorded in his notes, “he consented.” “I arranged to have the
information released anonymously to the Sheriff’s Department with
directions to the bodies.” He noted that there was “no provable way to
connect” McClure to the information, “but I think it’s rather obvious
from those in the know, who the information came from.”</p>
<p>In the deposition conducted in conjunction with McClure’s state
habeas proceeding, Mecca gave a similar account of the events
surrounding disclosure of the locations of the children. He emphasized
that “it all happened relatively quickly” and that there was a public
“hysteria about these kids, whether the kids were dead, whether the kids
were alive.” Mecca reiterated that much of the later conversations with
McClure consisted of hypotheticals and fantasies—“like he was playing a
game with me”—but that it was clear that McClure wanted to tell him
where the children were. Mecca stated in his deposition that “the
condition of the children was never discussed,” but that the insistence
by McClure’s mother and sister that McClure wouldn’t hurt the children
put him “in this mode of thinking these kids might be alive
someplace.”</p>
<p>Mecca testified in his deposition that he thought that if the
children were alive, it might relieve McClure of additional murder
charges, but that the children were his main concern. When asked if he
was “primarily concerned with the children’s welfare or with
Mr. McClure’s welfare” at the time he disclosed the location of the
bodies, Mecca replied, “At that point I was concerned with the
children’s welfare.” When asked if he explained to McClure that “if they
were in fact dead, that revealing the location of the bodies would lead
to evidence which could implicate Mr. McClure in their murders,” Mecca
answered: “No. I don’t think I had the presence of mind to sit down and
analyze every single detail and go over with him, ‘Geez, you know, if
they are really dead, why don’t you tell me.’” However, he testified,
“McClure knew I thought there was a chance those kids were alive.”</p>
<p>Mecca testified in the deposition that the plan to place the
anonymous telephone call was his, but that McClure knew that he planned
to do it, and that, in his late-night call, McClure had made clear that
he “absolutely wanted to disclose where those kids were.” When asked,
“Did he give you permission to reveal this information?” Mecca
responded, “Oh, yes.”</p>
<p>In a 1999 affidavit submitted in conjunction with McClure’s federal
habeas proceeding, Mecca gave an additional statement regarding
McClure’s consent: “Mr. McClure did not orally or expressly consent to
the disclosure. I inferred consent from the circumstances, specifically,
the fact that Mr. McClure called me at home on several occasions with
the request that I see him at the jail, and the fact that he drew a map
of the location of the bodies of the victim in his own handwriting and
gave me the map.”</p>
<p>In addition to reviewing Mecca’s notes, his state-court deposition
testimony, and his federal-court affidavit, the federal district court
heard testimony from Mecca at an evidentiary hearing. In this testimony,
Mecca emphasized that he generally takes a low-keyed approach to
questioning his clients. He also emphasized that McClure was “fully
engaged in his defense” and “was running the show.” Every time they met
or conversed, he said, it was at McClure’s request. He said that he and
McClure “discussed at various times various methods of what I was going
to do with this information.” Mecca testified that McClure never
expressly said that he consented to the disclosure, and that Mecca never
asked for such consent. He confirmed his earlier testimony that he
inferred consent, and added for the first time that this inference was
based on McClure’s nodding, saying “okay,” and otherwise manifesting
assent. He said this was what he had meant when he had written in his
notes that McClure consented. Mecca also reiterated that he never told
McClure of the legal risks involved in disclosing the children’s
locations.</p>
<p>Mecca testified that after the Monday conversation with McClure, “the
conclusion I came to was that, without telling me, he told me he had
killed three people.” But he stated that he did not confirm that
conclusion by directly asking McClure if it was the case. Instead, he
said, he emphasized to McClure that if there was a chance the children
were alive, they needed to save them, and in response McClure “never
said they were dead.” After the “Jesus saved the kids” comment on
Tuesday, Mecca testified, “I allowed myself to believe that these kids
might somehow be alive.” When asked on cross examination whether, at the
time he decided to make the anonymous call, he thought there was “a
strong possibility the kids still may be alive,” Mecca responded that he
“felt that it was a possibility. I wouldn’t say a strong possibility.”
One of the reasons he felt this possibility existed, he said, was that
his “client had not indicated anything differently.” He testified that
the possibility of saving his client from additional murder charges “was
something that was going through his mind” during his decisionmaking. He
noted that the weather at that time of year was “warm” and “pleasant,”
and that if the children had been left in the woods it was possible that
the weather would not have contributed to their death.</p>
<p>McClure disagreed with Mecca’s account of the events leading up to
the anonymous call. In testimony in both the state and federal district
court proceedings, he repeatedly insisted that he did not give Mecca
permission to disclose any information and that he was reassured that
everything he told Mecca would remain confidential. He said Mecca
pressured him into disclosing information by setting up the meeting with
his sister and mother, and then disseminated that information to his
detriment without his knowledge or consent.</p>
<p>McClure testified that Mecca never asked him directly if the children
were alive or dead, but that the hypothetical conversations that they
had were about where Mecca might find dead “bodies,” not live
“children.” He said his disclosure of those locations was his way of
admitting to having killed them. He testified that Mecca never told him
that he intended to make an anonymous telephone call.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
III. Discussion
</p>
<p>McClure’s single claim is that habeas relief is appropriate because
he received ineffective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment.
He asserts three independent grounds on which ineffectiveness could be
found. The first two are based on alleged breaches of Mecca’s
professional duty to maintain client confidentiality. McClure argues
that this duty was breached both by a failure to obtain informed consent
prior to the disclosure of confidential information and by a failure to
inquire thoroughly before concluding that disclosure was necessary to
prevent the deaths of the children. The third ground is that the primacy
of Mecca’s concern for the victims constituted a conflict of interest
that rendered Mecca’s counsel constitutionally ineffective.</p>
<p class="case-h2">
A. The Duty of Confidentiality
</p>
<p>McClure contends that Mecca’s disclosure of McClure’s confidential
statements about the location of the children violated McClure’s Sixth
Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. ABA Model Rule of
Professional Conduct 1.6 sets forth a widely recognized duty of
confidentiality: “A lawyer shall not reveal information relating to
representation of a client.” Our legal system is premised on the strict
adherence to this principle of confidentiality, and “the Supreme Court
has long held attorneys to stringent standards of loyalty and fairness
with respect to their clients.” There are few professional relationships
“involving a higher trust and confidence than that of attorney and
client,” and “few more anxiously guarded by the law, or governed by
sterner principles of morality and justice.”</p>
<p>As critical as this confidential relationship is to our system of
justice, the duty to refrain from disclosing information relating to the
representation of a client is not absolute. The ABA Model Rule provides
a list of well-established exceptions to the general principle of
confidentiality, two of which are pertinent to the present case. First,
a lawyer may reveal confidential information if “the client consents
after consultation.” Second, “a lawyer may reveal such information to
the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary to prevent the
client from committing a criminal act that the lawyer believes is likely
to result in imminent death or substantial bodily harm.” The relevant
provisions of the Oregon Code of Professional Responsibility echo both
the general principle of confidentiality and these particular
exceptions.</p>
<p>The duty of an attorney to keep his or her client’s confidences in
all but a handful of carefully defined circumstances is so deeply
ingrained in our legal system and so uniformly acknowledged as a
critical component of reasonable representation by counsel that
departure from this rule “makes out a deprivation of the Sixth Amendment
right to counsel.” With this uncontested premise as our starting point,
we examine whether the circumstances surrounding Mecca’s revelation of a
confidential client communication excused his disclosure, such that his
performance could have been found by the state court and the district
court to be constitutionally adequate. Specifically, we look to see if
Mecca’s client “consented after consultation” or if Mecca “reasonably
believed the revelation was necessary to prevent the client from
committing a criminal act that Mecca believed was likely to result in
imminent death or substantial bodily harm.” We conclude that the first
of these exceptions does not apply to justify Mecca’s behavior, but that
the second does.</p>
<p><em>1. Consent After Consultation</em></p>
<p>McClure argues that Mecca rendered constitutionally ineffective
assistance because he breached his duty of confidentiality by not
obtaining McClure’s informed consent before disclosure. The professional
standard that allows disclosure of confidential communications when “the
client consents after consultation” has two distinct parts: consent by
the client, and consultation by the counsel. Our required deference to
both the state court’s factual findings and the district court’s
credibility determination leads us to hold that the first of these
elements was met. However, despite this deference, we hold that the
second element was not met.</p>
<p><em>a. Consent</em></p>
<p>The state court made the following finding: “Trial counsel received
petitioner’s permission to anonymously disclose the whereabouts of the
children to the authorities.” AEDPA demands that this finding of consent
be presumed correct and accepted as true unless McClure rebuts the
presumption with clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. The
district court, whose credibility determinations are given great weight,
and whose findings of fact are reviewed only for clear error, explicitly
accepted that finding, and stated that it did “not find credible
petitioner’s assertion that he did not consent to the disclosure of the
information contained in the map.” It found that McClure “voluntarily
drew the map and gave it to Mecca,” and that, even in the absence of the
words “I consent,” Mecca could infer consent from the circumstances and
from McClure’s conduct. It stated that it found Mecca’s testimony
“entirely credible and corroborated by his contemporaneous notes which
state specifically that petitioner consented to the disclosure.”</p>
<p>There is evidence in the record to cast doubt on these consent
findings—indeed, enough evidence that if we were sitting as trier of
fact, we might find that McClure did not give consent. McClure
repeatedly denied that he consented, and certainly would have had good
reason not to consent. The state court determination that McClure had
consented was made before Mecca clarified that the consent was implied
and not express. Moreover, it was based on Mecca’s unconditional
affirmative response, in his state-court deposition, to the question of
whether permission to reveal the information was granted. Only later, in
the federal habeas proceeding, did it come to light that Mecca had
merely inferred McClure’s consent.</p>
<p>Further, Mecca’s account of the circumstances from which he inferred
McClure’s consent changed over the years. His initial account stated
that he inferred consent from the fact that McClure called him at home,
drew the map, and gave it to him. It is a significant leap to infer
McClure’s consent to disclose the map to law enforcement authorities
from the fact that McClure gave the map to Mecca. Virtually all clients
provide information to their attorneys, but they do so assuming that the
attorneys will not breach their duty of confidentiality. Further,
Mecca’s behavior at the time of the disclosure suggested that he thought
he lacked the kind of informed consent that would give him the legal
authority to act.</p>
<p>However, the findings reached by the state and district courts are
not so “implausible”—particularly in light of the district court’s
credibility determinations—that they produce a “definite and firm
conviction that a mistake has been committed.” The district court
believed Mecca’s account at the evidentiary hearing, disbelieved
McClure’s, and found the discrepancies in Mecca’s testimony to be
“minor.” Because there are “two permissible views of the evidence, the
factfinder’s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.” We
therefore hold that McClure gave his consent to the disclosure.</p>
<p><em>b. Consultation</em></p>
<p>However, the mere fact of consent is not sufficient to excuse what
would otherwise be a breach of the duty of confidentiality. Consent must
also be informed. That is, the client can provide valid consent only if
there has been appropriate “consultation” with his or her attorney.
Mecca’s consultation with McClure regarding his consent to disclosure
was addressed in the state court and district court findings. Both
courts found that Mecca did not advise McClure about the potential
harmful consequences of disclosure. The state court found that “before
petitioner authorized trial counsel to reveal the childrens’ locations
to authorities, trial counsel did not advise petitioner that if
authorities located the children, he could be further implicated in the
criminal activity and the evidence against him would be stronger.” The
district court found that “Mecca admits that he did not advise
petitioner of all potential adverse consequences.”</p>
<p>Emphasizing that McClure was “fully engaged” in his defense and that
he was told that the obligation to disclose the children’s location
arose only if the children were alive, the district court held that
“under the circumstances, Mecca’s failure to advise petitioner of all
possible adverse consequences was not unreasonable.” We believe this
holding is inconsistent with the consultation requirement because it
does not attach sufficient importance to the role that an attorney’s
advice plays in the attorney-client relationship. It is not enough, as
the district court suggests, that McClure “did not dissuade Mecca from
his intentions” to share the map with authorities. The onus is not on
the client to perceive the legal risks himself and then to dissuade his
attorney from a particular course of action. The district court’s
statement that Mecca was relieved of his duty to counsel his client
because “common sense dictated that petitioner understood the
consequences of his actions” fails to acknowledge the seriousness of
those consequences and the importance of good counsel regarding them.
Even in cases in which the negative ramifications seem obvious—for
example, when criminal defendants opt for self-representation—we require
that a criminal defendant’s decision be made on the basis of legal
guidance and with full cautionary explanation. We disagree with the
district court’s conclusion that this case was so exceptional that the
attorney’s basic consultation duties did not apply. It is precisely
because the stakes were so high that Mecca had an obligation to consult
carefully with his client. In the absence of some other exception to the
duty of confidentiality, his failure to obtain informed consent would
demonstrate constitutionally deficient performance under the Sixth
Amendment.</p>
<p><em>2. Prevention of Further Criminal Acts</em></p>
<p>The State contends that, even if Mecca did not have informed consent,
his revelation of client confidences did not amount to ineffective
assistance of counsel because he reasonably believed that disclosing the
location of the children was necessary in order to prevent further
criminal acts. That is, Mecca reasonably believed that revealing the
children’s locations could have prevented the escalation of kidnapping
to murder. This is not a traditional “prevention of further criminal
acts” case, because all of the affirmative criminal acts performed by
McClure had been completed at the time Mecca made his disclosure. Mecca
was thus acting to prevent an earlier criminal act from being
transformed by the passage of time into a more serious criminal offense.
Nonetheless, we believe that where an attorney’s or a client’s omission
to act could result in “imminent death or substantial bodily harm”
constituting a separate and more severe crime from the one already
committed, the exception to the duty of confidentiality may be
triggered.</p>
<p>This exception, however, requires that an attorney reveal confidences
only to the extent that he “reasonably believes necessary to prevent”
those criminal acts and imminent harms. In assessing the effectiveness
of McClure’s counsel in light of this standard, the first step is to
determine what a constitutionally effective counsel should be required
to do before making a disclosure. That is, we must determine what basis
the attorney had for believing that the precondition to disclosure was
present, and how much investigation he or she must have undertaken
before it was “reasonable” to “believe it necessary” to make the
disclosure to prevent the harm. The second step is to apply that
standard to the facts surrounding Mecca’s decision to disclose.</p>
<p>There is remarkably little case law addressing the first analytical
step. Citing cases dealing with a separate confidentiality exception
allowing attorneys to reveal intended perjury on the part of their
clients, McClure argues that a lawyer must have a “firm factual basis”
before adopting a belief of impending criminal conduct. However, we are
not persuaded that the perjury cases provide the proper standard.</p>
<p>McClure is correct that our inquiry must acknowledge the importance
of the confidential attorney-client relationship and the gravity of the
harm that results from an unwarranted breach of that duty. However, the
standard applied in the professional responsibility code asks only if
the attorney “reasonably believes” disclosure is necessary to prevent
the crime. Further, the <em>Strickland</em> standard likewise focuses on
“whether counsel’s assistance was reasonable considering all the
circumstances.” Accordingly, we hold that the guiding rule for purposes
of the exception for preventing criminal acts is objective
reasonableness in light of the surrounding circumstances.</p>
<p>Reasonableness of belief may be strongly connected to adequacy of
investigation or sufficiency of inquiry in the face of uncertainty.
Significantly, as indicated above, <em>Strickland</em> explicitly
imposes a duty on counsel “to make reasonable investigations or to make
a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.”
In any ineffectiveness of counsel case, “a particular decision not to
investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the
circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel’s
judgments.” Thus, in determining whether Mecca’s disclosure of
confidential client information constituted ineffective assistance of
counsel, we must examine whether Mecca “reasonably believed” that the
precondition for disclosure existed and whether, in coming to that
belief, Mecca conducted a reasonable investigation and inquiry.</p>
<p>The parties vigorously debate both the reasonableness of Mecca’s
belief that the children were alive and the reasonableness of his level
of investigation and inquiry on that point. McClure argues that any
conclusion that Mecca had a reasonable belief is unsupported because
Mecca himself indicated that he harbored doubts as to the children’s
state, and yet failed to inquire further. He points to evidence in the
record that Mecca, at least at some stages of his representation of
McClure, did not believe the children were alive—or that he, at the
least, suspected that they were dead. It is indisputable that this
evidence exists, and that most of this evidence is contained in
statements by Mecca himself, whom the district court found “highly
credible.” Mecca’s notes state that, after McClure drew the map, Mecca
“felt in my own mind that the children were dead, but, of course, I
wasn’t sure.” He testified in the district court evidentiary hearing
that the conclusion he came to was that, “without telling me, McClure
had told me he had killed three people.” And he stated in this same
testimony that, at the time he had his secretary place the anonymous
call, he thought there was a “possibility,” but not a “strong
possibility,” that the children were alive.</p>
<p>McClure argues that the statement Mecca says abruptly changed his
mind about the status of the children—McClure’s comment that “Jesus
saved the kids”—was so vague and ambiguous that it was not a sufficient
basis for a “reasonable belief” that disclosure was necessary. Despite
Mecca’s acknowledgment that this comment led him only to “assume” that
McClure was saying the children were alive, Mecca never directly asked a
question that could have confirmed or refuted that assumption. Mecca
repeatedly testified that he never squarely asked about the condition of
the children or whether McClure had killed them. Accordingly, McClure
argues, any finding that Mecca believed the children were alive is not
sufficient to establish effective assistance of counsel, because Mecca’s
failure to engage in a reasonable level of investigation and inquiry
rendered that belief unreasonable.</p>
<p>Given the implicit factual findings of the state court, and the
explicit factual findings of the district court, which are at least
plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, we disagree.
The ultimate question of the reasonableness of Mecca’s belief is a
question of law, which we review <em>de novo</em>. In answering that
question, however, we look to the facts and circumstances of the case,
and as to these facts, we give great deference to the findings of the
state court and the district court.</p>
<p>The district court made a number of specific findings regarding the
factual basis for Mecca’s belief that the children were alive. It found
that only McClure knew the true facts and that he deliberately withheld
them, leading Mecca to believe the children were alive. It found that
McClure controlled the flow of information, and that when Mecca informed
McClure that he had an obligation to disclose the children’s whereabouts
if there were a chance they were alive, McClure did not tell him they
were dead. It specifically rejected McClure’s assertion that Mecca in
fact believed that the children were dead or that he lacked information
that they were alive, noting that at the time there was no evidence,
other than their disappearance and the passage of time, that they had
been injured or killed.</p>
<p>The district court also made specific factual findings regarding the
nature of Mecca’s investigation and inquiry. It found that “Mecca
attempted to discern whether the children were alive” and “that Mecca
investigated to the best of his ability under extremely difficult
circumstances.” McClure argues that these findings are clearly
erroneous, and that “arguments that Mr. McClure was manipulative and
difficult are essentially irrelevant to the lawyer’s obligations.” But
<em>Strickland</em> holds otherwise. The <em>Strickland</em> Court
emphasized that “the reasonableness of counsel’s actions may be
determined or substantially influenced by the defendant’s own statements
or actions.” More specifically, it held that “what investigation
decisions are reasonable depends critically” on the “information
supplied by the defendant.”</p>
<p>This is a close case, even after we give the required deference to
the state and district courts. The choices made by McClure’s counsel
give us significant pause, and, were we deciding this case as an
original matter, we might decide it differently. But we take as true the
district court’s specific factual findings as to what
transpired—including what McClure said and did, and what actions Mecca
took and why he took them—and we conclude that Mecca made the disclosure
“reasonably believing it was necessary to prevent the client from
committing a criminal act that Mecca believed was likely to result in
imminent death or substantial bodily harm.” Mecca therefore did not
violate the duty of confidentiality in a manner that rendered his
assistance constitutionally ineffective.</p>

I
</p>
<p>On Saturday, March 23, 1996, at about 10:00 a.m., Metropolitan Police
officers found Darcie Silver dead in her apartment after they received a
call from her concerned co-workers reporting that she had failed to show
up for work. The medical examiner determined that the cause of death was
asphyxia by strangulation; other injuries indicated that she might also
have been smothered. In addition, there were burns around her genital
area; pieces of burned newspaper were found in the vicinity of her
crotch. A vaginal swab revealed the presence of male deoxyribonucleic
acid (DNA). In addition, investigators found semen stains on
Ms. Silver’s nightgown and on a denim jacket recovered from her
apartment. The DNA evidence was later matched to appellant through
testing by the FBI.</p>
<p>A police investigation revealed that on Friday evening, March 22,
Ms. Silver had dinner with a co-worker from her job at Bread &amp;
Circus, a supermarket in the Georgetown area of the city. She returned
to her apartment at approximately 10:00 p.m. and spoke to her father on
the telephone from 10:47 p.m. on Friday until 12:03 a.m. on
Saturday.</p>
<p>Two neighbors in Ms. Silver’s apartment building heard a knocking at
the front door of the building at about 2:30 a.m. on Saturday. One of
the neighbors looked out a window and saw a “stocky” man with a fair to
medium complexion at the door. This description was similar to that of
appellant, who is a weightlifter and bodybuilder. Both neighbors heard
the man respond to the building intercom using the name “Darcie.” They
then heard him say that he had locked himself out of his apartment and
needed to borrow a telephone. The intercom made a buzzing noise, which
unlocked the front door, and the man walked upstairs to the area of
Ms. Silver’s apartment. About fifteen minutes later, one neighbor heard
a “crash” coming from Silver’s apartment, and the other heard a loud
“thump.”</p>
<p class="case-h1">
II
</p>
<p>Appellant’s primary argument on appeal is that the court erred when
it ruled that the attorney-client privilege did not attach to a
conversation that he had with his girlfriend at the time, Tina Ducharme,
who was also a lawyer.</p>
<p>After Darcie Silver was murdered, the police interviewed several
employees, including appellant, at the Bread &amp; Circus store where
Ms. Silver worked. The police requested hair and blood samples from
appellant, but he declined to give them. He told the police that his
girlfriend was a lawyer and that he “wanted to talk to her first and he
even invited them to come to his house to talk to them if they wanted
to, but only in her company.” Later appellant called his girl friend,
Tina Ducharme, a lawyer who worked for the federal government. At the
time, she was away on business in San Diego. Appellant left a message at
her hotel there, and she returned his call some time thereafter.</p>
<p>During their telephone conversation, appellant told Ms. Ducharme
about the police interview at Bread &amp; Circus. Defense counsel moved
to exclude any testimony from Ms. Ducharme about that conversation. At a
pre-trial hearing on the motion, Ms. Ducharme testified that appellant
“told me that the police had been by his work and had questioned him and
several other people who used to work with Darcie and had asked for
blood samples from several individuals.” Ms. Ducharme’s response to
appellant’s concern was that “obviously he didn’t have to provide the
police with a sample if they didn’t have a warrant.” She also asked him,
however, “why he wouldn’t, since it would clear the air. Obviously he
didn’t have anything to do with it or didn’t have anything to be
concerned about. I didn’t understand why he wouldn’t just go ahead and
do it.” Appellant also told her that “he had been in Darcie’s apartment
before, and he questioned whether or not some fingerprints of his would
be remaining in the apartment,” particularly on some drinking glasses.
Ms. Ducharme replied with the “common sense advice” that “probably
Darcie had washed her glasses in the intervening amount of time.”
Finally, appellant asked “what if he had gone to the bathroom and left
some sperm in there?” Ms. Ducharme laughed and commented that “unless he
was masturbating in her bathroom, I really didn’t think that would be a
concern.” Ms. Ducharme testified that appellant never said anything
about her representing him in a criminal matter, nor did she intend to
advise appellant as a lawyer, adding, “I wasn’t qualified to advise
anyone on criminal matters.” Appellant, in fact, had never asked her to
perform any legal work on his behalf. Besides, she said, she was barred
by a regulation from representing any private individual “either
criminally or civilly” because she was a government lawyer. Further, she
believed the conversation was a typical call between boyfriend and
girlfriend: “when either of us had a problem, we would call the other
person to ask their advice or tell them about it.”</p>
<p>Appellant’s account of the conversation was different. He stated that
he telephoned Ms. Ducharme because he “wanted to know what kind of
position I would be putting myself in by giving hair and blood samples.”
Appellant said that he called her “because she’s an attorney” and that
he “was seeking legal advice.” He testified, “I never thought she could
be subpoenaed or anything because she was an attorney.” On the basis of
his prior experience with other attorneys, appellant believed their
conversation would remain confidential.</p>
<p>At the close of the hearing, the court ruled that the conversation
was not protected by the attorney-client privilege. Accepting
Ms. Ducharme’s version of the conversation as credible, the court found
appellant’s testimony incredible because he “kept switching around on
the witness stand as if he was waiting on which way to go.” In addition,
the court ruled that the only thing Ms. Ducharme “said as a lawyer” was
that appellant did not have to give the police hair and blood samples,
which he had already elected not to do. Otherwise, said the court, the
types of questions appellant asked Ms. Ducharme were “what if” questions
that were more scientific than legal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They were questions about—they’re scientific questions. And she
wasn’t a criminal lawyer to begin with. What if I used a glass, would
the fingerprints still be there? Not a legal question. What if I went to
the bathroom, would I have semen there? That’s not a legal question.
None of these were legal questions. The only legal question in this
thing he already knew the answer to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result, the court refused to allow appellant to invoke the
attorney-client privilege, and Ms. Ducharme’s testimony about the
telephone conversation was later introduced into evidence at trial.</p>
<p>In the case at bar, the court heard testimony about the nature and
substance of the conversation between appellant and his one-time girl
friend, Ms. Ducharme. It made a credibility determination about the
contents of the conversation and a factual finding that Ms. Ducharme was
not acting as an attorney, but as a friend. On this record we see no
reason to depart from our usual standard of review for factual findings
by a trial court; <em>i.e.</em>, we must uphold that court’s
determination of the facts unless it is “plainly wrong or without
evidence to support it.” In particular, a trial court’s “findings of
fact relevant to the essential elements of a claim of attorney-client
privilege will not be overturned unless clearly erroneous.” This
standard of review places a heavy burden on appellant. Because appellant
has not shown that the trial court’s factual findings were clearly
erroneous or, in the words of our statute, “plainly wrong,” we uphold
the court’s rejection of his claim of privilege.</p>
<p>The attorney-client privilege is the oldest of the established
privileges for confidential communications. Its main purpose is to
encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their
clients. Nevertheless, courts construe the attorney-client privilege
narrowly to protect only those purposes which it serves. Thus the
privilege applies only in the following circumstances:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>where legal advice of any kind is sought (2) from a professional
legal advisor in his capacity as such, (3) the communications relating
to that purpose, (4) made in confidence (5) by the client, (6) are at
his instance permanently protected (7) from disclosure by himself or by
the legal adviser, (8) except the protection be waived.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The burden of proving that the attorney-client privilege shields a
particular communication from disclosure rests with the party asserting
the privilege. This means that the party asserting the privilege must
clearly show that the communication was made “in a professional legal
capacity.” “In general, American decisions agree that the privilege
applies if one of the significant purposes of a client in communicating
with a lawyer is that of obtaining legal assistance.”</p>
<p>Whether a purpose is significantly that of obtaining legal assistance
or is for a nonlegal purpose depends upon the circumstances, including
the extent to which the person performs legal and nonlegal work, the
nature of the communication in question, and whether or not the person
had previously provided legal assistance relating to the same
matter.</p>
<p>In the case of someone seeking advice from a friend who is also a
lawyer, the lawyer-friend must be giving advice as a lawyer and not as a
friend in order for the privilege to attach. The nature of the
relationship is a factual question for the trial court to decide.</p>
<p>Finally, the relationship between attorney and client hinges on the
client’s intention to seek legal advice and his belief that he is
consulting an attorney. In this case the government argues that the
conversation in question was not privileged because Ms. Ducharme was not
a criminal lawyer; because, as a government employee, she was barred by
a regulation from representing appellant—or any other individual—in a
private capacity; and because she believed that she was speaking to
appellant as his girlfriend and not as a lawyer.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">(n.4 in opinion) During the evidentiary hearing,
defense counsel attempted to impeach Ms. Ducharme with her grand jury
testimony. Before the grand jury, Ms. Ducharme initially testified that
she gave appellant advice “as a lawyer,” but then stated a few moments
later that appellant had called her “as his girlfriend.” The trial court
presumably considered this discrepancy but nevertheless found
Ms. Ducharme credible.<br>
<br>
</span></span> These arguments fall short, however, because the intent
of the person seeking advice is assessed from that person’s viewpoint,
not that of the attorney. The issue ultimately is what appellant
believed when he was seeking advice and whether his belief about the
confidentiality of the conversation was reasonable. Thus Ms. Ducharme’s
understanding of the conversation and of why appellant had called her is
relevant only to whether appellant reasonably believed he was consulting
her as an attorney, with the protections that such a relationship
provides.</p>
<p>Guided by these principles, we agree with the trial court that
appellant failed to make the clear showing necessary to establish that
his conversation with Ms. Ducharme was within the protection of the
attorney-client privilege. We note that the trial court found
appellant’s testimony incredible, in part, because he appeared to have
tailored his testimony to fit the legal standard for the privilege,
which counsel and the court had discussed in front of him during the
hearing. The court said to defense counsel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s the court’s observation that appellant is very bright. And I was
especially fond of his answer to counsel’s last question about whether
he heard me. Then counsel and I had this legal discussion, at which time
your client then answered the question, he didn’t understand the
concept. It’s as if we helped him answer the question, the two of
us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, the court ruled that the questions appellant asked
Ms. Ducharme were not “legal” questions. The court noted that appellant
knew his rights when he refused to provide blood and hair samples to the
police. According to Ms. Ducharme, whose testimony the court expressly
credited, appellant did not inquire about his right not to give samples
without a warrant, but instead asked “scientific” questions about
whether or not his fingerprints might remain on a glass or whether his
semen and hair might be discovered in the bathroom.</p>
<p>While such concerns about “bad facts” might fall within the privilege
if they were expressed in a communication within a clearly established
attorney-client relationship, we conclude, like the trial court, that
appellant failed to establish that, as a matter of fact, such a
relationship existed between him and Ms. Ducharme. We see no reason to
upset the court’s conclusion, which rested largely on its determination
that Ms. Ducharme was credible and that appellant was not. We find no
error in that determination.</p>

<h4>People v. Belge, 83 Misc.2d 186 (N.Y. County Court 1975)</h4>
<p class="case-h1">
Ormand N. Gale, J.
</p>
<p>In the summer of 1973 Robert F. Garrow, Jr., stood charged in
Hamilton County with the crime of murder. The defendant was assigned two
attorneys, Frank H. Armani and Francis R. Belge. A defense of insanity
had been interposed by counsel for Mr. Garrow. During the course of the
discussions between Garrow and his two counsel, three other murders were
admitted by Garrow, one being in Onondaga County. On or about September
of 1973 Mr. Belge conducted his own investigation based upon what his
client had told him and with the assistance of a friend the location of
the body of Alicia Hauck was found in Oakwood Cemetery in Syracuse.
Mr. Belge personally inspected the body and was satisfied, presumably,
that this was the Alicia Hauck that his client had told him that he
murdered.</p>
<p>This discovery was not disclosed to the authorities, but became
public during the trial of Mr. Garrow in June of 1974, when to
affirmatively establish the defense of insanity, these three other
murders were brought before the jury by the defense in the Hamilton
County trial. Public indignation reached the fever pitch, statements
were made by the District Attorney of Onondaga County relative to the
situation and he caused the Grand Jury of Onondaga County, then sitting,
to conduct a thorough investigation. As a result of this investigation
Frank Armani was no-billed by the Grand Jury but Indictment No. 75-55
was returned as against Francis R. Belge, Esq., accusing him of having
violated subdivision 1 of section 4200 of the Public Health Law, which,
in essence, requires that a decent burial be accorded the dead, and
section 4143 of the Public Health Law, which, in essence, requires
anyone knowing of the death of a person without medical attendance, to
report the same to the proper authorities. Defense counsel moves for a
dismissal of the indictment on the grounds that a confidential,
privileged communication existed between him and Mr. Garrow, which
should excuse the attorney from making full disclosure to the
authorities.</p>
<p>The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, as amicus
curiae, succintly state the issue in the following language: If this
indictment stands, “The attorney-client privilege will be effectively
destroyed. No defendant will be able to freely discuss the facts of his
case with his attorney. No attorney will be able to listen to those
facts without being faced with the Hobson’s choice of violating the law
or violating his professional code of Ethics.”</p>
<p>Initially in England the practice of law was not recognized as a
profession, and certainly some people are skeptics today. However, the
practice of learned and capable men appearing before the court on behalf
of a friend or an acquaintance became more and more demanding.
Consequently, the King granted a privilege to certain of these men to
engage in such practice. There had to be rules governing their duties.
These came to be known as “Canons”. The King has, in this country, been
substituted by a democracy, but the “Canons” are with us today, having
been honed and refined over the years to meet the changes of time. Most
are constantly being studied and revamped by the American Bar
Association and by the bar associations of the various States. While
they are, for the most part, general by definition, they can be brought
to bear in a particular situation. Among those is the following, cited
in <em>United States v Funk</em>: “Confidential communications between
an attorney and his client are privileged from disclosure * * * as a
rule of necessity in the administration of justice.”</p>
<p>In the most recent issue of the New York State Bar Journal (June,
1975) there is an article by Jack B. Weinstein, entitled “Educating
Ethical Lawyers”. In a subcaption to this article is the following
language which is pertinent: “The most difficult ethical dilemmas result
from the frequent conflicts between the obligation to one’s client and
those to the legal system and to society. It is in this area that legal
education has its greatest responsibility, and can have its greatest
effects.” In the course of his article Mr. Weinstein states that there
are three major types of pressure facing a practicing lawyer. He uses
the following language to describe these: “First, there are those that
originate in the attorney’s search for his own wellbeing. Second,
pressures arise from the attorney’s obligation to his client. Third, the
lawyer has certain obligations to the courts, the legal system, and
society in general.”</p>
<p>Our system of criminal justice is an adversary system and the
interests of the State are not absolute, or even paramount. “The dignity
of the individual is respected to the point that even when the citizen
is known by the state to have committed a heinous offense, the
individual is nevertheless accorded such rights as counsel, trial by
jury, due process, and the privilege against self incrimination.”</p>
<p>A trial is in part a search for truth, but it is only partly a search
for truth. The mantle of innocence is flung over the defendant to such
an extent that he is safeguarded by rules of evidence which frequently
keep out absolute truth, much to the chagrin of juries. Nevertheless,
this has been a part of our system since our laws were taken from the
laws of England and over these many years has been found to best protect
a balance between the rights of the individual and the rights of
society.</p>
<p>The concept of the right to counsel has again been with us for a long
time, but since the decision of <em>Gideon v Wainwright</em>, it has
been extended more and more so that at the present time a defendant is
entitled to have counsel at a parole hearing or a probation violation
hearing.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of counsel is only as great as the confidentiality
of its client-attorney relationship. If the lawyer cannot get all the
facts about the case, he can only give his client half of a defense.
This, of necessity, involves the client telling his attorney everything
remotely connected with the crime.</p>
<p>Apparently, in the instant case, after analyzing all the evidence,
and after hearing of the bizarre episodes in the life of their client,
they decided that the only possibility of salvation was in a defense of
insanity. For the client to disclose not only everything about this
particular crime but also everything about other crimes which might have
a bearing upon his defense, requires the strictest confidence in, and on
the part of, the attorney.</p>
<p>When the facts of the other homicides became public, as a result of
the defendant’s testimony to substantiate his claim of insanity,
“Members of the public were shocked at the apparent callousness of these
lawyers, whose conduct was seen as typifying the unhealthy lack of
concern of most lawyers with the public interest and with simple
decency.” A hue and cry went up from the press and other news media
suggesting that the attorneys should be found guilty of such crimes as
obstruction of justice or becoming an accomplice after the fact. From a
layman’s standpoint, this certainly was a logical conclusion. However,
the Constitution of the United States of America attempts to preserve
the dignity of the individual and to do that guarantees him the services
of an attorney who will bring to the Bar and to the Bench every
conceivable protection from the inroads of the State against such rights
as are vested in the Constitution for one accused of crime. Among those
substantial constitutional rights is that a defendant does not have to
incriminate himself. His attorneys were bound to uphold that concept and
maintain what has been called a sacred trust of confidentiality.</p>
<p>The following language from the brief of the amicus curiae further
points up the statements just made: “The client’s Fifth Amendment rights
cannot be violated by his attorney. There is no viable distinction
between the personal papers and criminal evidence in the hands or mind
of the client. Because the discovery of the body of Alicia Hauck would
have presented ‘a significant link in a chain of evidence tending to
establish his guilt’, Garrow was constitutionally exempt from any
statutory requirement to disclose the location of the body. And Attorney
Belge, as Garrow’s attorney, was not only equally exempt, but under a
positive stricture precluding such disclosure. Garrow, although
constitutionally privileged against a requirement of compulsory
disclosure, was free to make such a revelation if he chose to do so.
Attorney Belge was affirmatively required to withhold disclosure. The
criminal defendant’s self-incrimination rights become completely
nugatory if compulsory disclosure can be exacted through his
attorney.”</p>
<p>In the recent and landmark case of <em>United States v Nixon</em> the
court stated: “the constitutional need for production of relevant
evidence in a criminal proceeding is specific and neutral to the fair
adjudication of a particular criminal case in the administration of
justice. Without access to specific facts a criminal prosecution may be
totally frustrated.” In the case at bar we must weigh the importance of
the general privilege of confidentiality in the performance of the
defendant’s duties as an attorney, against the inroads of such a
privilege on the fair administration of criminal justice as well as the
heart tearing that went on in the victim’s family by reason of their
uncertainty as to the whereabouts of Alicia Hauck. In this type
situation the court must balance the rights of the individual against
the rights of society as a whole. There is no question but Attorney
Belge’s failure to bring to the attention of the authorities the
whereabouts of Alicia Hauck when he first verified it, prevented
bringing Garrow to the immediate bar of justice for this particular
murder. This was in a sense, obstruction of justice. This duty, I am
sure, loomed large in the mind of Attorney Belge. However, against this
was the Fifth Amendment right of his client, Garrow, not to incriminate
himself. If the Grand Jury had returned an indictment charging Mr. Belge
with obstruction of justice under a proper statute, the work of this
court would have been much more difficult than it is.</p>
<p>There must always be a conflict between the obstruction of the
administration of criminal justice and the preservation of the right
against self incrimination which permeates the mind of the attorney as
the alter ego of his client. But that is not the situation before this
court. We have the Fifth Amendment right, derived from the Constitution,
on the one hand, as against the trivia of a pseudo-criminal statute on
the other, which has seldom been brought into play. Clearly the latter
is completely out of focus when placed alongside the client-attorney
privilege. An examination of the Grand Jury testimony sheds little light
on their reasoning. The testimony of Mr. Armani added nothing new to the
facts as already presented to the Grand Jury. He and Mr. Belge were
cocounsel. Both were answerable to the Canons of professional ethics.
The Grand Jury chose to indict one and not the other. It appears as if
that body were grasping at straws.</p>
<p>It is the decision of this court that Francis R. Belge conducted
himself as an officer of the court with all the zeal at his command to
protect the constitutional rights of his client. Both on the grounds of
a privileged communication and in the interests of justice the
indictment is dismissed.</p>

<section id="hofmann-v.-conder-712-p.2d-216-utah-1985" class="level4">
<h4>Hofmann v. Conder, 712 P.2d 216 (Utah 1985)</h4>
<p>This matter comes before the Court in an extraordinary proceeding to
prohibit the district court from compelling petitioner’s hospital nurse
to testify about statements she overheard petitioner make to his
attorney. The trial court made no findings of fact, although it prepared
a memorandum decision. It appears from that decision that the
controlling issue on which the trial court decided the matter was a
legal one, namely, the standard determining when the presence of a third
party during communications between a lawyer and client results in a
waiver of the attorney-client privilege. We hold that the trial court
erred in deciding that the attorney-client privilege applies only if the
presence of a third person, who overhears a confidential communication,
is “necessary for urgent or life-saving procedures.” The proper standard
is whether the third person’s presence is reasonably necessary under the
circumstances.</p>
<p>The record establishes that the presence of petitioner’s hospital
nurse was reasonably necessary under the circumstances. The threshold
question of whether the communication was intended to be confidential
was not ruled on by the trial court, or at least the judge’s decision
gives us no indication of his having made any factual findings on that
question. Although there are ambiguities in the record, the totality of
the circumstances surrounding petitioner’s communications to his
attorney require the inference that the communication was intended to be
confidential and within the protection of the statutory privilege.
Immediately before the communication, petitioner had requested the
presence of his attorney, he had stated that he would not make a
statement to the police that night, and he had acquiesced in the request
of his attorney that the police and hospital security personnel not only
leave the room but also go far enough away to be out of earshot. Given
his helpless physical condition and the intensive nature of the hospital
care he had been receiving throughout the evening and during this
incident, we cannot infer that petitioner intended his communications to
his attorney to be public. Since the presence of the hospital nurse was
reasonably necessary under all the circumstances, the privilege was not
waived because of that presence.</p>
<p>The order of the trial court is vacated, and this matter is remanded
for the entry of a protective order preventing the disclosure by the
witness of confidential communications overheard by her.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
ZIMMERMAN, Justice (dissenting).
</p>
<p>I agree that Judge Conder applied the wrong standard in concluding
that the presence of the nurse made the attorney-client privilege
unavailable. A third person’s presence should not avoid an otherwise
available privilege if the third person’s presence is reasonably
necessary under the circumstances. The evidence indicates that the
nurse’s presence was reasonably necessary for Hofmann’s well-being.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">(n.2 in opinion) I also conclude that the privilege is
not lost if a third person whose presence is not otherwise justified
overhears a confidential attorney-client communication without the
client’s knowledge, so long as reasonable precautions were taken to
protect against overhearing. However, because the nurse’s presence was
justified, the reasonableness of the precautions taken to exclude third
parties has no bearing on the question before us.<br>
<br>
</span></span></p>
<p>I disagree with the result reached by the Court, however, and would
uphold the ruling below, because I conclude that petitioner has not met
the threshold requirement for claiming an attorney-client
privilege—petitioner has failed to establish that the communication
between the client and the attorney was intended by the client to be
confidential. “The mere fact that the relationship of attorney and
client exists between two individuals does not ipso facto make all
communications between them confidential. The circumstances must
indicate whether by implication the communication was of a sort intended
to be confidential.” I think the Court slights this inquiry. By failing
to carefully consider the question of the client’s intent, courts may
shield from scrutiny communications that the privilege was not created
to protect.</p>
<p>There is evidence in the record sufficient to establish that the
attorney thought the communication was at least private and perhaps
confidential. However, I find the record very sparse on the question of
the client’s intention. Although the client was available to give an
affidavit in support of his claim of privilege, the record is strangely
devoid of direct evidence as to the client’s state of mind at the time
of the communication. As for the facts and circumstances in the record
that constitute indirect evidence of his intent, I find them ambiguous
at best. All persons must give evidence, unless they establish a
recognized justification for refusing to do so. Petitioner has the
burden of establishing that the communication was privileged. On the
present state of the record, I conclude that petitioner has not carried
this burden. Therefore, I would uphold the trial court’s refusal to find
the communication privileged.</p>

<h4>X Corp. v. Doe, 805 F.Supp. 1298 (E.D. Va. 1992)</h4>
<p class="case-h1">
Ellis, District Judge
</p>
<p>Few problems are as vexing as determining what evidence justifies a
lawyer’s disclosure of a client’s confidential information and
documents, which the lawyer believes reflect an ongoing or future crime
or fraud. This case presents precisely this problem. Plaintiff, X
Corp. brings this suit, in part, to prevent defendant, John Doe, X
Corp.’s former in-house counsel, from disclosing X Corp.’s confidential
information and documents retained by Doe following his discharge from X
Corp. X Corp. also seeks return of the documents. In support of the
relief sought, X Corp. cites the attorney-client privilege, the parties’
confidentiality agreement, and the lawyer’s general duty to preserve a
client’s confidences. For his part, Doe claims that the documents in
issue disclose ongoing civil and criminal frauds perpetrated by X
Corp. against the federal government. As such, according to Doe, the
documents fall within the public policy crime-fraud exception to the
attorney-client privilege and to any general or contractual duty of
confidentiality.</p>
<p>The matter is before the Court on X Corp.’s motion for a preliminary
injunction. For the reasons stated here, the motion is granted in part
and denied in part.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
Facts
</p>
<p>X Corp. hired Doe in March 1989 as a member of its in-house legal
staff based in Northern California. Formerly an Associate Deputy
Attorney General of the United States and Chief of Staff to the Attorney
General, Doe was a member of the bar of the state of Pennsylvania. When
he was hired, Doe executed an “Employment, Invention and Confidential
Information Agreement”, in which he expressly agreed (i) to return to X
Corp. all records obtained during, or in connection with, his employment
and (ii) to preserve X Corp.’s confidential information. Thereafter, in
the course of his employment, Doe regularly received confidential
information from X Corp. management and its employees in order to
provide legal opinions and advice. During approximately two years with X
Corp., Doe apparently excelled; his professional performance was
regarded as excellent. Eventually he was promoted to Group Counsel with
primary responsibility worldwide for X Corp.’s compliance with numerous
government regulations and antitrust laws.</p>
<p>In November 1990, Doe was transferred from X Corp.’s California
office to Virginia as X Corp.’s only United States-based lawyer outside
California. The parties sharply dispute the reason for the transfer. In
X Corp.’s view, the transfer occurred because Doe failed the California
bar examination. Doe, on the other hand, asserts that he initiated the
transfer to escape California’s high cost of living and because he and
his wife wanted to live closer to their relatives in Virginia. Doe also
contends that X Corp. negotiated with him to retain his services because
he was “an important contributor and asset” and because X Corp. wanted
to locate a regulatory and antitrust attorney near Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>X Corp. terminated Doe’s employment effective February 28, 1992,
providing him with thirty-one weeks severance pay. The reason for Doe’s
discharge is as hotly disputed as the reason for the transfer. X
Corp. claims Doe was laid-off as part of a company-wide reduction in
force involving over 700 employees. Doe counters, however, that he was
unlawfully fired in retaliation for actions X Corp. believed he was
taking in furtherance of a possible qui tam suit. On leaving X Corp.’s
employ, Doe took with him copies of certain documents and files, leaving
the originals with X Corp. Doe claims these documents reveal that X
Corp. is defrauding the federal government, in violation of the False
Claims Act. The documents submitted in camera are plainly relevant to
these allegations. But without explanatory testimony or evidence, their
significance in terms of establishing an ongoing fraudulent scheme is
not entirely clear.</p>
<p>By letter dated February 28, 1992, Doe, through counsel, asserted a
state law wrongful termination claim against X Corp., provided X
Corp. with a draft complaint, and offered to discuss the matter prior to
filing the complaint in this Court. The draft complaint contained
specific references to, as well as excerpts from, X Corp.’s allegedly
confidential documents. Thereafter, on March 5, 1992, X Corp. filed this
lawsuit on the public record of this Court, but at that time, neither
served Doe nor informed him of the suit’s existence. X Corp.’s complaint
asserts five causes of action: (i) breach of fiduciary duty by allegedly
revealing confidences to his own attorney; (ii) breach of the
Confidentiality Agreement; (iii) recovery of the allegedly
misappropriated documents and records; (iv) injunctive relief to prevent
disclosure of alleged confidential information in his personal claim
against X Corp. or for any purpose; and (v) a declaratory judgment that
Doe may not disclose the allegedly confidential information. X
Corp. claims that filing this action was necessary to prevent disclosure
of X Corp.’s confidential information in the event Doe filed his draft
complaint on the public record. That circumstance never materialized, as
Doe ultimately consented to delay filing his wrongful termination action
and then to do so under temporary seal, which he did on April 7, 1992.
One week later, X Corp. notified Doe of the existence of this
action.</p>
<p>On April 20, 1992, X Corp. moved this Court for a preliminary
injunction (i) to maintain Doe’s wrongful termination lawsuit, and all
pleadings and papers filed therein, under seal until its conclusion;
(ii) to prohibit Doe and his lawyer from making any disclosures of X
Corp.’s allegedly privileged and confidential information; and (iii) to
compel Doe to return all allegedly misappropriated documents. Doe, by
counsel, agreed to refrain from further disclosures of X Corp.’s claimed
confidential information until the Court’s ruling. On May 4, 1992, Doe
filed his counterclaim alleging retaliatory discharge.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
Analysis
</p>
<p>Without doubt, this litigation presents “grave or serious questions,”
questions involving difficult and troubling ethical issues arising in
the context of attorney-client confidentiality. Few questions are graver
or more serious in the practice of law than determining what evidence of
crime or fraud justifies a lawyer’s disclosure of his client’s
confidential information. Moreover, allegations of attorney misconduct,
or even potential misconduct, engender significant and serious questions
of professional conduct critical to the client, to the accused attorney,
and to the bar as a whole. Such allegations, regardless of their
veracity, erode the already fragile public confidence in the legal
profession and in the administration of justice. And it is undeniable
that our legal system cannot function effectively unless the public has
confidence in the integrity and competence of the system and its
participants. Thus, it is paramount that lawyers understand and abide by
settled and accepted norms of professional conduct. But even settled and
accepted norms frequently provide inadequate or ambiguous guidance in
the face of specific factual circumstances. So it is here.</p>
<p>This litigation focuses on two professional standards of attorney
confidentiality—(i) the evidentiary attorney-client privilege and (ii)
the broader ethical duty of confidentiality—and their application to the
specific facts presented. Understanding the distinction between these
two standards is essential to the matter at bar. For that reason, it is
worth describing them here in some detail.</p>
<p>The first of these standards, the evidentiary attorney-client
privilege, is quite familiar, and the principles associated with it are
well-settled. This evidentiary privilege applies to disclosures of
certain types of confidences communicated between client and attorney
during the course of the attorney’s representation of the client. To
prevent such disclosures, the client, through counsel or otherwise, may
invoke the privilege. The purpose of the attorney-client privilege</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and
their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the
observance of law and administration of justice. The privilege
recognizes that sound legal advice or advocacy serves public ends and
that such advice or advocacy depends upon the lawyer’s being fully
informed by the client.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Upjohn Co. v. United States</em>, 449 U.S. 383, 389 (1981).
Nevertheless, because it “impedes the full and free discovery of the
truth,” and is “in derogation of the public’s ‘right to every man’s
evidence,’” the attorney-client privilege is not “favored” by federal
courts. Accordingly, the privilege is narrowly construed to apply only
to those situations in which the party invoking the privilege consulted
an attorney for the purpose of securing a legal opinion or services and
in connection with that consultation communicated information intended
to be kept confidential.</p>
<p>The privilege is determined on a case-by-case basis. It well-settled
that the privilege protects corporate as well as individual clients, and
that it attaches to in-house as well as outside counsel. The party
seeking to invoke the privilege bears the burden of establishing that
the attorney-client relationship existed, that the particular
communications at issue are privileged, and that the privilege has not
been waived.The Fourth Circuit has adopted the “classic test” for
application of the attorney-client privilege announced in <em>United
Shoe Machinery Corp.</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The privilege applies only if (1) the asserted holder of the
privilege is or sought to become a client; (2) the person to whom the
communication was made (a) is a member of the bar of a court, or his
subordinate and (b) in connection with this communication is acting as a
lawyer; (3) the communication relates to a fact of which the attorney
was informed (a) by his client (b) without the presence of strangers (c)
for the purpose of securing primarily either (i) an opinion on law or
(ii) legal services or (iii) assistance in some legal proceeding, and
not (d) for the purpose of committing a crime or tort; and (4) the
privilege as been (a) claimed and (b) not waived by the client.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the exception to the privilege commonly known as the
“crime-fraud exception,” communications made for an unlawful purpose or
to further an illegal scheme are not privileged. For example, the
attorney-client privilege is extinguished when an attorney “is consulted
not with respect to past wrongdoings but rather to further a continuing
or contemplated criminal or fraudulent scheme.” But the privilege may
also be overcome even in circumstances where the attorney is not
consulted for the purpose of furthering a crime or fraudulent scheme.
Thus, the privilege cannot be used as a shield to preclude disclosure of
information concerning an ongoing or future crime or fraud collaterally
learned by a lawyer during the course of his representation.</p>
<p>To overcome an established privilege using the crime-fraud exception,
the party opposing the privilege need make only a prima facie showing
that the communications either (i) were made for an unlawful purpose or
to further an illegal scheme or (ii) reflect an ongoing or future
unlawful or illegal scheme or activity. The purported crime or fraud
need not be proved. Requiring only a prima facie showing may lead to the
disclosure of confidential communications that do not reflect a genuine
crime or fraud. Presumably, this would occur infrequently. The
alternative—requiring actual proof of the crime or fraud in lieu of the
prima facie showing—imposes an impractical and unduly burdensome
standard that tips the balance too far in favor of confidentiality and
against the “full and free discovery of the truth.”</p>
<p>The evidentiary attorney-client privilege, while more familiar, is
not the lawyer’s only duty of confidentiality to a client. Too often
unrecognized is the broader ethical duty of an attorney to preserve a
client’s confidences and secrets that may fall outside the
attorney-client privilege. The leading case discussing this ethical duty
is the Fifth Circuit’s decision in Brennan’s Inc. v. Brennan’s
Restaurants, Inc., 590 F.2d 168 (5th Cir.1979). There, defendants took
the position that the attorney-client privilege barred an attorney from
further representation of a former joint client. The Fifth Circuit
disagreed, noting that “the fundamental flaw in defendants’ position is
a confusion of the attorney-client evidentiary privilege with the
ethical duty to preserve a client’s confidences.” The panel held that
although a former joint client could not assert the attorney-client
privilege as to matters encompassed by the former joint representation
because confidences cannot arise between joint clients, a broader
ethical duty protects joint clients. In this regard, the court
stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Information acquired [from a client] is sheltered from use by the
attorney against his client by virtue of the existence of the
attorney-client relationship. This is true without regard to whether
someone else may be privy to it. The obligation of an attorney not to
misuse information acquired in the course of representation serves to
vindicate the trust and reliance that client’s place in their attorneys.
A client would feel wronged if an opponent prevailed against him with
the aid of an attorney who formerly represented the client in the same
matter this would undermine public confidence in the legal system as a
means for adjudicating disputes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the Fifth Circuit sensibly recognized in Brennan’s and Doe,
attorney confidentiality is essential to sustaining public confidence in
the legal profession and the legal system. Clients therefore have a
right to enforce that confidentiality, absent specific circumstances
abrogating 1308*1308 that right. Of course, an attorney’s duty to his
client is limited by his duty to comply with the law and the standards
of professional conduct.</p>
<p>Consistent with most jurisdictions, Virginia recognizes a broad duty
of confidentiality in Canon 4 of the Virginia Code of Professional
Responsibility, which states: “A Lawyer Should Preserve the Confidences
and Secrets of a Client.” The corresponding Disciplinary Rules provide
in relevant part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DR4-101. Preservation of Confidences and Secrets of a Client.—(A)
“Confidence” refers to information protected by the attorney-client
privilege under applicable law, and “secret” refers to other information
gained in the professional relationship that the client has requested be
held inviolate or the disclosure of which would be embarrassing or would
be likely to be detrimental to the client.</p>
<ol start="2" type="A">
<li>Except as provided by DR 4-101(C) and (D), a lawyer shall not
knowingly:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Reveal a confidence or secret of his client.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a confidence or secret of his client to the disadvantage of
the client.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a confidence or secret of his client for the advantage of
himself or a third person, unless the client consents after full
disclosure.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, mandatory Disciplinary Rule 4-101 defines two categories of
protected information: (i) a narrow category of “confidences,”
comprising information protected by the attorney-client privilege, and
(ii) a broader category of “secrets,” encompassing “other information
gained in the professional relationship that the client has requested be
held inviolate or the disclosure of which would be embarrassing or would
be likely to be detrimental to the client.” In distinguishing between
these two categories, Virginia has manifest its intention to protect
from disclosure a range of communications broader than that protected by
the attorney-client privilege. Confidentiality of both categories of
information must be maintained. Yet the duty of confidentiality imposed
by the Virginia Code of Professional Responsibility is not absolute. A
lawyer may reveal confidences and secrets in specific circumstances.
Relevant here is a provision, similar in purpose and effect to the
crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege, permitting an
attorney to reveal “information which clearly establishes that his
client has, in the course of the representation, perpetuated upon a
third party a fraud related to the subject matter of the
representation.” Information “clearly establishes” the perpetration of a
fraud if it is information that a reasonable attorney in the same
circumstances would find convincing evidence of the alleged fraudulent
activities.</p>
<p>Yet despite its similar purpose, DR4-101(C)(3)’s “clearly
establishes” standard imposes a heavier burden on the party seeking
disclosure than the prima facie standard of the crime-fraud exception to
the attorney-client privilege. In other words, matters subject to the
attorney-client privilege seem to be less stringently protected from
disclosure than matters subject to the ethical privilege. This, at first
blush, seems puzzling, indeed paradoxical, for one would think that the
attorney-client privilege deserves the greater protection. On
reflection, however, the two different standards make sense given that
they apply in different contexts. Succinctly put, the evidentiary
attorney-client privilege arises only where disclosures are sought to be
compelled in some litigation context, whereas the broader ethical duty
arises in the context of voluntary or uncompelled disclosures, typically
outside a litigation context. More particularly, the attorney-client
privilege is an evidentiary privilege applicable where someone seeks to
compel an attorney or his client to reveal communications between lawyer
and client made for the purpose of securing a legal opinion or legal
services and intended to be kept confidential. Thus, the privilege
arises in the context of litigation and is therefore subject to
discipline of the adversary process and the safeguard of judicial
scrutiny, if the affected client invokes the privilege and the opposing
party seeks to overcome it. Significantly, however, the evidentiary
attorney-client privilege does not control where disclosures occur, or
potential disclosures are contemplated, in circumstances involving
uncompelled disclosure and no judicial scrutiny. In such circumstances,
the ethical duty—with its appropriately higher standard of protection
against unwarranted disclosure of suspected fraudulent
activities—governs. The voluntary nature of the actual or potential
disclosures and the absence of judicial scrutiny justify the higher
“clearly establishes” standard for disclosure of purported evidence of
ongoing or future fraud. In sum, the prima facie standard under the
crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege is a standard
applied in the litigation context by judges, not lawyers, for the
purpose of deciding whether to compel the disclosure of putatively
privileged material. By contrast, the more stringent “clearly
establishes” standard for disclosure of confidential information is one
that is applied in the first instance by lawyers, not judges, as they
struggle with the decision whether voluntarily to disclose certain
confidential information they believe reflects an ongoing or future
fraud. Judges apply the “clearly establishes” standard in the second
instance only to review post hoc whether a voluntary disclosure was
ethically appropriate or, as here, to decide whether to enjoin a
potential voluntary disclosure.</p>
<p>In light of these principles, any reliance here on the evidentiary
attorney-client privilege and its crime-fraud exception is misplaced.
This is not a case involving compelled disclosures. No one seeks to
compel Doe to disclose privileged material against X Corp.’s invocation
of the attorney-client privilege. Rather, this is a case of voluntary
disclosure; Doe voluntarily has disclosed or wishes to disclose a broad
range of information X Corp. believes should be treated confidentially.
Thus, applicable here is the broader ethical duty of confidentiality and
the “clearly establishes” standard for disclosure of evidence of
fraud.</p>
<p>Given this, in proving its claim that Doe is obligated to maintain
its confidences pursuant to the ethical duty, X Corp. bears the initial
burden of establishing that the duty exists and that the disputed
communications are subject to it. To do so, X Corp. must show, <em>inter
alia</em>, that the communications sought to be protected are
“confidences” or “secrets” within the meaning of Virginia Code of
Professional Responsibility DR4-101(A). If X Corp. carries this burden
and establishes that Doe is ethically bound not to disclose this
material, the burden then shifts to Doe to show that the material and
information he voluntarily disclosed or seeks to disclose “clearly
establish[]” that during the course of Doe’s representation, X
Corp. perpetrated a fraud related to the subject matter of the
representation upon a third party, namely, the federal government. To
accomplish this, Doe must demonstrate more than mere suspicion of fraud;
he must show that a reasonable attorney in his position would find the
communications at issue to be convincing evidence of the perpetration of
a fraud on the government during the course of his representation
related to the subject matter of that representation. But the fraud
itself need not be conclusively proved. Thus, the issue for trial is not
whether X Corp. was in fact perpetrating a fraud on the government.
Rather, the primary issues for trial are (i) what Doe knew or should
have known at the time of the intended disclosures (or the time X
Corp. sought to enjoin disclosures) and (ii) whether a reasonable
attorney with that knowledge would find that it clearly establishes an
ongoing or planned fraud, that is, that it constitutes convincing
evidence of an ongoing or planned fraud. If Doe satisfies the “clearly
establishes” standard, disclosure is permissible (but not required),
even if X Corp. ultimately proves that no fraud existed.</p>
<p>There may be circumstances where ongoing or contemplated frauds
actually exist, but disclosure is impermissible because the evidence
relied on by the attorney falls short of clearly establishing the fraud.
This result might permit the fraud to continue. But neither mere
suspicion of fraud, nor the mere risk of undiscovered fraud, justify
abrogating the duty of attorney confidentiality. A windfall to a
wrongdoer may be the price exacted for the benefits conferred on the
public and the legal system by vigilantly-maintained attorney
confidentiality.</p>

<h4>In the Matter of a Grand Jury Investigation, 453 Mass. 453
(2009)</h4>
<p class="case-h1">
Spina, J.
</p>
<p>This case requires us to decide whether the attorney-client privilege
applies where a client leaves messages on his counsel’s telephone
answering machine threatening to harm others and the attorney discloses
those communications in order to protect those threatened.</p>
<p>The salient facts are not in dispute. Attorney John Doe was
representing Michael Moe, a father, in a care and protection proceeding
in the Juvenile Court. On November 8, 2007, two days after an adverse
ruling by a Juvenile Court judge, Moe left six messages on Attorney
Doe’s answering machine between 1:08 A.M. and 1:24 A.M. Moe indicated
that he knew where the judge lived and that she had two children. In the
fourth message, a voice that Attorney Doe recognized as Moe’s wife
stated that she and Moe were going to “raise some hell.” In the fifth
message, Moe stated that “some people need to be exterminated with
prejudice.” Attorney Doe subsequently erased the messages from the
answering machine.</p>
<p>During the following week, Attorney Doe observed that Moe had become
“more and more angry,” and on November 13, 2007, he filed a motion to
withdraw as Moe’s counsel, which was subsequently allowed. Concerned for
the safety of the judge and her family, he disclosed the substance of
the messages to the judge.</p>
<p>On November 21, 2007, Attorney Doe was interviewed by a State trooper
regarding the substance of the messages, but declined to sign a written
statement.</p>
<p>A District Court complaint alleging threats to commit a crime and
intimidation of a witness subsequently issued against Moe. The
Commonwealth then initiated grand jury proceedings and filed a motion to
summons Attorney Doe before the grand jury. That motion was allowed. On
December 21, 2007, Attorney Doe, citing the attorney-client privilege,
moved to quash the summons. A judge in the Superior Court denied
Attorney Doe’s motion, reasoning that Attorney Doe and Moe had not
carried their burden of demonstrating that the attorney-client privilege
applied “because they failed to show that the messages were left in an
attempt to obtain legal services.” Attorney Doe filed a motion to
reconsider, requesting, <em>inter alia</em>, an evidentiary hearing. The
motion was denied. The Commonwealth and Attorney Doe submitted a joint
request to report the decision to the Appeals Court. The Superior Court
judge reported the case, and we transferred the case here on our own
motion.</p>
<p>Neither party disputes that Attorney Doe could, consistent with rule
1.6, disclose the substance of Moe’s messages. Rule 1.6 provides, in
pertinent part:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol type="a">
<li>A lawyer shall not reveal confidential information relating to
representation of a client unless the client consents after
consultation, except for disclosures that are impliedly authorized in
order to carry out the representation, and except as stated in paragraph
(b). (b) A lawyer may reveal, and to the extent required by Rule 3.3,
Rule 4.1(b), or Rule 8.3 must reveal, such information: (1) to prevent
the commission of a criminal or fraudulent act that the lawyer
reasonably believes is likely to result in death or substantial bodily
harm.”</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>While nothing in rule 1.6(b) required Attorney Doe to disclose Moe’s
communications to the judge or police, he had discretion to do so.
However, the ethical permissibility of Attorney Doe’s disclosure does
not resolve the distinct issue presented here: whether Attorney Doe can
be compelled to testify before the grand jury.</p>
<p>Evidentiary privileges “are exceptions to the general duty imposed on
all people to testify.” We accept such privileges “only to the very
limited extent that permitting a refusal to testify or excluding
relevant evidence has a public good transcending the normally
predominant principle of utilizing all rational means for ascertaining
truth.” The attorney-client privilege “is founded upon the necessity, in
the interest and administration of justice, of the aid of persons having
knowledge of the law and skilled in its practice, which assistance can
only be safely and readily availed of when free from the consequences or
the apprehension of disclosure.” A party asserting the privilege must
show that (1) the communications were received from the client in
furtherance of the rendition of legal services; (2) the communications
were made in confidence; and (3) the privilege has not been waived.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth contends that the attorney-client privilege does not
apply because Moe’s communications were not made “for the purpose of
facilitating the rendition of legal services.” In making this argument,
the Commonwealth implicitly asks us to reconsider a portion of our
discussion in the <em>Purcell</em> case.</p>
<p>In <em>Purcell</em>, the client was discharged as a maintenance man
at the apartment building in which his apartment was located and had
received an order to vacate his apartment. During consultation with an
attorney, the client stated an intent to burn the apartment building.
The attorney disclosed these communications to police and criminal
charges were brought against the client. When the prosecutor subpoenaed
the attorney to testify at trial, the attorney filed a motion to quash,
which was denied. The central issue in that case was whether the
crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege applied. We
concluded that the communications would not fall within the crime-fraud
exception unless the district attorney could establish facts by a
preponderance of the evidence showing that the client’s communication
sought assistance in or furtherance of future criminal conduct.</p>
<p>Recognizing that whether the attorney-client privilege applied at all
was open on remand, we also considered whether a communication of an
intention to commit a crime, if not within the crime-fraud exception,
could be considered a communication for the purposes of facilitating the
rendition of legal services. We held that a “statement of an intention
to commit a crime made in the course of seeking legal advice is
protected by the privilege, unless the crime-fraud exception applies.”
We reasoned that a gap between the crime-fraud exception and the
applicability of the privilege “would make no sense,” because the
attorney-client privilege was premised on the benefits of unimpeded
communication between attorney and client, and noted that “an informed
lawyer may be able to dissuade the client from improper future conduct
and, if not, under the ethical rules may elect in the public interest to
make a limited disclosure of the client’s threatened conduct.”</p>
<p>The limited disclosure adverted to in the <em>Purcell</em> case
occurred here. Concerned for the safety of the judge, her family, and a
social worker, Attorney Doe disclosed Moe’s communications to the judge
and law enforcement authorities to protect them from harm.</p>
<p>We discern no reason to depart from the <em>Purcell</em> decision,
and hold that Moe’s communications were made in furtherance of the
rendition of legal services and thus protected by the attorney-client
privilege. The Commonwealth’s argument to the contrary essentially
raises an issue of germaneness. Scholars, commentators, and courts have
formulated a number of tests for determining the germaneness of a
client’s communication. However, none of these formulations appears to
give clients breathing room to express frustration and dissatisfaction
with the legal system and its participants. The expression of such
sentiments is a not uncommon incident of the attorney-client
relationship, particularly in an adversarial context, and may serve as a
springboard for further discussion regarding a client’s legal options.
If a lawyer suspects that the client intends to act on an expressed
intent to commit a crime, the lawyer may attempt to dissuade the client
from such action, and failing that, may make a limited disclosure to
protect the likely targets. Requiring the privilege to yield for
purposes of a criminal prosecution not only would hamper attorney-client
discourse, but also would discourage lawyers from exercising their
discretion to make such disclosures, as occurred here, and thereby
frustrate the beneficial public purpose underpinning the discretionary
disclosure provision of rule 1.6. Furthermore, any test to ascertain the
germaneness of an ostensibly threatening communication on a case-by-case
basis would make the privilege’s applicability uncertain, rendering the
privilege “little better than no privilege.” Warning clients that
communications deemed irrelevant to the matter for which they have
retained counsel will not be protected not only may discourage clients
from disclosing germane information, but also may disincline clients to
share their intentions to engage in criminal behavior. In the latter
circumstance, a lawyer’s ability to aid in the administration of justice
by dissuading a client from engaging in such behavior is impaired. The
lawyer also may never receive the very information necessary for him or
her to determine whether to make a limited disclosure to prevent the
harm contemplated by the client.</p>
<p>In sum, we reaffirm that a client’s communications to his lawyer
threatening harm are privileged unless the crime-fraud exception
applies. Because the Commonwealth does not assert that Moe’s
communications come within the crime-fraud exception, they were
privileged. The order denying Attorney Doe’s motion to quash is hereby
vacated and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

<h4>Sporck v. Peil, 759 F.2d 312 (3d Cir. 1985)</h4>
<p class="case-h1">
JAMES HUNTER, III, Circuit Judge.
</p>
<p>This case arises on a Petition for Writ of Mandamus involving a
discovery dispute between the parties to a securities fraud class action
suit. The underlying action involves an allegation by
plaintiff-respondent Raymond K. Peil that defendant National
Semiconductor Corporation, defendant-petitioner Charles F. Sporck, NSC’s
president, and defendant Peter J. Sprague, NSC’s chairman, conspired to
inflate artificially the value of NSC stock, in order to enable Sporck
and Sprague to sell their own shares at the inflated level. The wrongful
conduct alleged includes various misrepresentations and nondisclosures
of material facts during an eight-month period continuing from July 1,
1976, until March 1, 1977.</p>
<p>During pretrial discovery, attorneys for Peil served numerous sets of
combined interrogatory and document requests on defendants. In response,
defendants produced hundreds of thousands of documents, from which
Peil’s attorneys selected more than 100,000 for copying. There is no
allegation in this case that defendants have improperly concealed or
refused to produce requested documents.</p>
<p>The issue presently before this court arose on May 16, 1983, at the
deposition of defendant-petitioner Sporck. Prior to the deposition,
counsel for defendants had prepared Sporck for his expected week-long
deposition by showing him an unknown quantity of the numerous documents
produced by defendants in response to plaintiff’s discovery requests.
Defense counsel selected and compiled these documents in a folder in
Philadelphia, and transported them to California solely for the
deposition. According to defense counsel, the selected documents
represented, as a group, counsel’s legal opinion as to the evidence
relevant both to the allegations in the case and the possible legal
defenses. It is conceded that none of the individual documents, in their
redacted form, contained work product of defense counsel.</p>
<p>At the inception of the Sporck deposition, Peil’s attorney asked:
“Mr. Sporck, in preparation for this deposition, did you have occasion
to examine any documents?” Sporck answered affirmatively, and Peil’s
attorney first orally, and then by written motion pursuant to Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 34, requested identification and production of
“all documents examined, reviewed or referred to by Charles E. Sporck in
preparation for the session of his deposition commencing May 16, 1983.”
Defense counsel refused to identify the documents, arguing first that
all the documents had previously been produced, and second, that the
select grouping of the documents was attorney work product protected
from discovery by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(3). Defense
counsel agreed, however, to allow Peil’s counsel to ask Sporck about his
reliance on individual documents in the context of specific factual
questions, and Sporck’s deposition continued on this basis.</p>
<p>Peil filed a motion to compel identification and production of the
selected documents, on the ground that all documents used in preparing a
witness for a deposition are properly discoverable under Federal Rule of
Evidence 612. Judge John B. Hannum granted Peil’s motion, and ordered
that defendant produce or identify all documents reviewed by Sporck in
preparation for his deposition. Upon petitioner’s motion for
reconsideration, Judge Hannum reaffirmed his order, holding that
although the select grouping of documents constituted attorney work
product, it was not “opinion” work product entitled to absolute
protection, and that the principles behind Federal Rule of Evidence 612
supported Peil’s claim to identification of the documents. Sporck now
asks this court to issue a writ of mandamus directing the trial court to
vacate both orders.</p>
<p>The threshold issue in this case is whether the selection process of
defense counsel in grouping certain documents together out of the
thousands produced in this litigation is work product entitled to
protection under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(3) and the
principles of <em>Hickman v. Taylor</em>. Petitioner concedes that the
individual documents that comprise the grouping are not attorney work
product, but argues that the selection process itself represents defense
counsel’s mental impressions and legal opinions as to how the evidence
in the documents relates to the issues and defenses in the litigation.
Because identification of the documents as a group will reveal defense
counsel’s selection process, and thus his mental impressions, petitioner
argues that identification of the documents as a group must be prevented
to protect defense counsel’s work product. We agree.</p>
<p>The work product doctrine had its modern genesis in the seminal
opinion in <em>Hickman v. Taylor</em>. In <em>Hickman</em>, the Court
rejected “an attempt, without purported necessity or justification, to
secure written statements, private memoranda and personal recollections
prepared or formed by an adverse party’s counsel in the course of his
legal duties.” Preserving the privacy of preparation that is essential
to the attorney’s adversary role is the central justification for the
work product doctrine. Without this zone of privacy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Much of what is now put down in writing would remain unwritten. An
attorney’s thoughts, heretofore inviolate, would not be his own.
Inefficiency, unfairness and sharp practices would inevitably develop in
the giving of legal advice and in the preparation of cases for trial.
The effect on the legal profession would be demoralizing. And the
interests of the clients and the cause of justice would be poorly
served.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The work product doctrine as articulated in Hickman has been
partially codified in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(3). That
rule conditions the production of “documents and tangible things”
prepared in anticipation of litigation by or for an opposing party on
the moving party’s showing of substantial need and undue hardship. Even
where such a showing is made, however, the trial court, in ordering the
production of such materials, “shall protect against disclosure of the
mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an
attorney or other representative of a party concerning the litigation.”
Thus, Rule 26(b)(3) recognizes the distinction between “ordinary” and
“opinion” work product first articulated by the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Opinion work product includes such items as an attorney’s legal
strategy, his intended lines of proof, his evaluation of the strengths
and weaknesses of his case, and the inferences he draws from interviews
of witnesses. Such material is accorded an almost absolute protection
from discovery because any slight factual content that such items may
have is generally outweighed by the adversary system’s interest in
maintaining the privacy of an attorney’s thought processes and in
ensuring that each side relies on its own wit in preparing their
respective cases.</p>
<p>We believe that the selection and compilation of documents by counsel
in this case in preparation for pretrial discovery falls within the
highly-protected category of opinion work product. As the court
succinctly stated in <em>James Julian, Inc. v. Raytheon Co.</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In selecting and ordering a few documents out of thousands counsel
could not help but reveal important aspects of his understanding of the
case. Indeed, in a case such as this, involving extensive document
discovery, the process of selection and distillation is often more
critical than pure legal research. There can be no doubt that at least
in the first instance the binders were entitled to protection as work
product.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further, in selecting the documents that he thought relevant to
Sporck’s deposition, defense counsel engaged in proper and necessary
preparation of his client’s case. As the Supreme Court noted in
<em>Hickman</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proper preparation of a client’s case demands that he assemble
information, sift what he considers to be the relevant from the
irrelevant facts, prepare his legal theories and plan his strategy
without undue and needless interference. That is the historical and the
necessary way in which lawyers act within the framework of our system of
jurisprudence to promote justice and to protect their client’s
interest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the instant case, without the protection that the work product
doctrine accords his preparation, defense counsel may have foregone a
sifting of the documents, or at the very least chosen not to show the
documents to petitioner. As a result, petitioner may not have been as
well-prepared for his deposition, and neither plaintiff nor defendant
would have realized the full benefit of a well-prepared deponent’s
testimony. For these reasons, Rule 26(b)(3) placed an obligation on the
trial court to protect against unjustified disclosure of defense
counsel’s selection process.</p>
<p>This conclusion, however, does not end the issue. Respondent argues,
and the trial court agreed, that operation of Federal Rule of Evidence
612 removed any protection that defense counsel’s selection process
would ordinarily enjoy. Because we find that Federal Rule of Evidence
612 does not apply to the facts of this case, we disagree.</p>
<p>Federal Rule of Evidence 612 provides in relevant part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a witness uses a writing to refresh his memory for the purpose of
testifying, (2) before testifying, if the court in its discretion
determines it is necessary in the interest of justice, an adverse party
is entitled to have the writing produced at the hearing, to inspect it,
to cross-examine the witness thereon, and to introduce in evidence those
portions which relate to the testimony of the witness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This rule is applicable to depositions and deposition testimony.
Although applicable to depositions, Rule 612 is a rule of evidence, and
not a rule of discovery. Its sole purpose is evidentiary in function -
“to promote the search of credibility and memory.”</p>
<p>By its very language, Rule 612 requires that a party meet three
conditions before it may obtain documents used by a witness prior to
testifying: 1) the witness must use the writing to refresh his memory;
2) the witness must use the writing for the purpose of testifying; and
3) the court must determine that production is necessary in the
interests of justice. The first requirement is consistent with the
purposes of the rule, for if the witness is not using the document to
refresh his memory, that document has no relevance to any attempt to
test the credibility and memory of the witness.</p>
<p>The second requirement—that the witness use the document for the
purpose of testifying—was designed “to safeguard against using the rule
as a pretext for wholesale exploration of an opposing party’s files and
to insure that access is limited only to those writings which may fairly
be said in part to have an impact upon the testimony of the witness.” As
with the first requirement, the second requirement recognizes that the
document is of little utility for impeachment and cross-examination
without a showing that the document actually influenced the witness’
testimony. Finally, the third requirement codifies the Supreme Court’s
holding in <em>Goldman v. United States</em>, that even though a witness
may review notes prior to testifying, a trial court should exercise
discretion to guard against “fishing expeditions among a multitude of
papers which a witness may have used in preparing for trial.”</p>
<p>In the case before us, the apparent conflict between the protected
status of defense counsel’s document selection process under Rule
26(b)(3) and the asserted need, for cross-examination purposes, of the
identification of the documents actually selected resulted from the
failure to establish the first two requirements under Rule 612. In
seeking identification of all documents reviewed by petitioner prior to
asking petitioner any questions concerning the subject matter of the
deposition, respondent’s counsel failed to establish either that
petitioner relied on any documents in giving his testimony, or that
those documents influenced his testimony. Without first eliciting the
testimony, there existed no basis for asking petitioner the source of
that testimony. We conclude, therefore, that deposing counsel failed to
lay a proper foundation under Rule 612 for production of the documents
selected by counsel.</p>
<p>Indeed, if respondent’s counsel had first elicited specific testimony
from petitioner, and then questioned petitioner as to which, if any,
documents informed that testimony, the work product petitioner seeks to
protect—counsel’s opinion of the strengths and weaknesses of the case as
represented by the group identification of documents selected by
counsel—would not have been implicated. Rather, because identification
of such documents would relate to specific substantive areas raised by
respondent’s counsel, respondent would receive only those documents
which deposing counsel, through his own work product, was incisive
enough to recognize and question petitioner on. The fear that counsel
for petitioner’s work product would be revealed would thus become
groundless.</p>
<p>Rule 612, therefore, when properly applied, does not conflict with
the protection of attorney work product of the type involved in this
case. Because the trial court did not properly condition its application
of Rule 612 on a showing that petitioner relied upon the requested
documents for his testimony and that those documents impacted on his
testimony, the court committed legal error. This error became
prejudicial when it implicated work product of petitioner’s counsel.
Proper application of Rule 612 should never implicate an attorney’s
selection, in preparation for a witness’ deposition, of a group of
documents that he believes critical to a case. Instead, identification
of such documents under Rule 612 should only result from opposing
counsel’s own selection of relevant areas of questioning, and from the
witness’ subsequent admission that his answers to those specific areas
of questioning were informed by documents he had reviewed. In such a
case, deposing counsel would discover the documents through his own wit,
and not through the wit of his adversary.</p>
<p>We conclude, therefore, that the trial court committed clear error of
law in ordering the identification of the documents selected by counsel.
Because we are confident that the district court will proceed in
accordance with our opinion without formal issuance of the writ, we will
remand to the district court.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
SEITZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting.
</p>
<p>The majority approves in effect the use of the work product doctrine
to prevent an identification of documents reviewed by a witness in
preparation for his deposition. I dissent because I am convinced that
such a ruling is an impermissible expansion of the work product doctrine
at the expense of legitimate discovery.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs-respondents sought in the district court the discovery
of relevant objective facts: the identities of the documents that the
deponent reviewed prior to testifying. These facts are not, in
themselves, the opinion or thought processes of an attorney. Nor were
the contents of the documents, all of which had already been produced by
the defendants, created by defendants’ attorney in anticipation of
litigation.</p>
<p>Yet, the defendant-petitioner claims that the mere identification of
the documents examined prior to his deposition would reveal his
attorney’s litigation strategy. Presumably, the petitioner’s argument
must be that if the respondents knew which documents were reviewed, they
could, upon examination of the documents identified, draw conclusions as
to why each document was chosen.</p>
<p>The problem with the petitioner’s theory is that it assumes that one
can extrapolate backwards from the results of a selection process to
determine the reason a document was selected for review by the deponent.
There are many reasons for showing a document or selected portions of a
document to a witness. The most that can be said from the fact that the
witness looked at a document is that someone thought that the document,
or some portion of the document, might be useful for the preparation of
the witness for his deposition. This is a far cry from the disclosure of
the lawyer’s opinion work product. Even assuming that the documents were
selected by the petitioner’s attorney, the subject matter is so
undifferentiated that its potential for invasion of work product is
miniscule at best.</p>
<p>Every act by a litigant or his attorney gives rise to similar vague
inferences. For example, a typical interrogatory from a leading treatise
would permit questions of the following form: “Identify each writing
which relates or refers directly or indirectly to a transaction in
question.” It cannot seriously be contended that an answer is not
required because it would reveal the fact that the attorney thought that
certain documents were relevant to the transaction.</p>
<p>Moreover, in order to claim the shield of opinion work product, it
must be established that it is the attorney’s thought processes that are
revealed. The respondents’ request did not require the identification of
the person who selected the documents. The only disclosed connection to
the petitioner’s attorney in our situation is that the petitioner
gratuitously volunteered the fact that his attorney selected the
documents. To permit this volunteered information to provide a necessary
link to attorney’s thought processes, as the majority has done, is to
permit the petitioner to cloak the non-work product aspects of the
information sought with work product protection. Certainly an attorney
cannot cloak a document under the mantle of work product by simply
reviewing it. It is difficult to see how an attorney or his witness may
insulate the discoverable fact that the witness reviewed a particular
document by volunteering that the attorney selected the document for
deposition preparation purposes.</p>
<p>Finally, the petitioner contends that the information sought was
“fact” work product, and that the respondents have made an insufficient
showing of need to require its production. Assuming without deciding
that the information sought was fact work product, I would not decide
this issue on a petition for a writ of mandamus. To reach this issue
would require us to review a decision committed to the discretion of the
district court, and such decisions do not constitute “clear and
indisputable” legal error. Further, revelation of fact work product does
not constitute the same sort of irreparable harm that would come from
the revelation of opinion work product.</p>
<p>Because I find no disclosure of the attorney’s work product that
would provide a basis for granting the writ, I would not reach the issue
of whether a proper foundation had been established for the requested
information under Federal Rule of Evidence 612 or the provision covering
relevant evidence found in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(1).
Decisions on such matters are not independently reviewable on a petition
seeking the extraordinary remedy of mandamus.</p>
<p>Based on the record presented by the petitioner, I fail to see how
any conclusions may be drawn as to what his attorney may or may not have
thought about this litigation. The mere identification of documents used
to prepare a witness for his deposition does not convey any meaningful
information of the type entitled to protection under the work product
doctrine. I would deny the petition.</p>

<h4>United States v. Deloitte LLP, 610 F. 3d 129 D.C. Cir. (2010)</h4>
<p class="case-h1">
SENTELLE, Chief Judge
</p>
<p>The United States appeals from a district court order denying its
motion to compel Dow Chemical Company’s independent auditor, Deloitte
&amp; Touche USA, LLP, to produce three documents in connection with
ongoing tax litigation between Dow and the government. The district
court ruled that all three documents were protected from discovery under
the work-product doctrine. On appeal, the government contends that one
of the documents is not work product because it was prepared by Deloitte
during the audit process. In addition, while it concedes that the other
two documents are work product, it argues that Dow waived work-product
protection when it disclosed them to Deloitte. We vacate the district
court’s decision that the document prepared by Deloitte is work product
and remand for in camera review to determine whether it is entirely work
product. With respect to the other two documents, we affirm the district
court’s decision that Dow did not waive work-product protection when it
disclosed them to Deloitte.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
I. Background
</p>
<p>This discovery dispute arises from ongoing tax litigation in the U.S.
District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana. The litigation
concerns the tax treatment of two partnerships owned by Dow Chemical
Company and two of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The first of these
partnerships was Chemtech I; it was succeeded by Chemtech II. In 2005,
Dow filed a civil suit challenging IRS adjustments to partnership
returns filed by Chemtech I and Chemtech II. During discovery, the
government subpoenaed documents from Dow’s independent auditor, Deloitte
&amp; Touche USA, LLP. Since the subpoena sought production in
Washington, D.C., it issued from the U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia. Deloitte produced a number of documents, but
refused to produce three documents Dow identified as attorney work
product. In response, the government filed a motion to compel
production.</p>
<p>The three disputed documents are described in Dow’s privilege log and
in a declaration by William Curry, Dow’s Director of Taxes. The first
document is a 1993 draft memorandum prepared by Deloitte that summarizes
a meeting between Dow employees, Dow’s outside counsel, and Deloitte
employees about the possibility of litigation over the Chemtech I
partnership, and the necessity of accounting for such a possibility in
an ongoing audit. This meeting took place after Dow informed Deloitte
about the likelihood of litigation over the Chemtech I transaction. The
second is a 1998 memorandum and flow chart prepared by two Dow
employees—an accountant and an in-house attorney. The third is a 2005
tax opinion prepared by Dow’s outside counsel. Curry’s declaration
explains that the second and third documents were disclosed to Deloitte
so that it could “review the adequacy of Dow’s contingency reserves for
the Chemtech transactions. According to Curry, Deloitte”compelled Dow’s
production of these documents by informing the company that access to
these documents was required in order to provide Dow with an unqualified
audit opinion for its public financial statements.” The privilege log
describes the subject matter of these documents as “tax issues related
to the Chemtech partnership” and states that each one is a “document
prepared in anticipation of litigation.” We will refer to the first
document, which was prepared by Deloitte, as the “Deloitte Memorandum,”
and the second and third documents, which were created by Dow, as the
“Dow Documents.”</p>
<p>The district court denied the government’s motion to compel without
reviewing the disputed documents in camera. It concluded that the
Deloitte Memorandum was work product because it was “prepared because of
the prospect of litigation with the IRS over the tax treatment of
Chemtech.” The court further concluded that, although the document was
created by Deloitte, it was nonetheless Dow’s work product because “its
contents record the thoughts of Dow’s counsel regarding the prospect of
litigation.” In addition, the court rejected the government’s contention
that Dow had waived work-product protection for the three documents. The
court acknowledged that disclosing work product to a third party can
waive protection if that disclosure is “inconsistent with the
maintenance of secrecy from the disclosing party’s adversary,” but
concluded that Dow’s disclosure to Deloitte was not inconsistent with
maintaining secrecy because (1) Deloitte was not a potential adversary
and (2) nothing suggested that it was unreasonable for Dow to expect
Deloitte to maintain confidentiality. The government appeals this
ruling, and Dow has intervened to assert work-product protection.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
II. Analysis
</p>
<p>The government contends that the Deloitte Memorandum is not attorney
work product. Alternatively, it argues that even if the Deloitte
Memorandum is work product, Dow waived work-product protection when it
orally disclosed the information recorded therein to Deloitte. Turning
to the Dow Documents, the government concedes they are attorney work
product, but argues that Dow waived work-product protection when it gave
them to Deloitte.</p>
<p class="case-h2">
A. The Work-Product Doctrine
</p>
<p>The Supreme Court established the work-product doctrine in
<em>Hickman v. Taylor</em>, which held that an attorney’s notes
recording his interviews with witnesses to the litigation-prompting
incident were protected from discovery. The Court recognized that to
prepare for litigation, an attorney must “assemble information, sift
what he considers to be the relevant from the irrelevant facts, prepare
his legal theories and plan his strategy without undue and needless
interference.” This preparation “is reflected in interviews, statements,
memoranda, correspondence, briefs, mental impressions, personal beliefs,
and countless other tangible and intangible ways.” The Court reasoned
that giving opposing counsel access to such work product would cause
significant problems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Much of what is now put down in writing would remain unwritten. An
attorney’s thoughts, heretofore inviolate, would not be his own.
Inefficiency, unfairness and sharp practices would inevitably develop in
the giving of legal advice and in the preparation of cases for trial.
The effect on the legal profession would be demoralizing. And the
interests of the clients and the cause of justice would be poorly
served.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consequently, the Court concluded that attorney work product is
protected from discovery unless “the one who would invade that privacy”
carries the burden of “establishing adequate reasons to justify
production through a subpoena or court order.”</p>
<p>The work-product doctrine announced in Hickman was subsequently
partially codified in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(3), which
states:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol type="A">
<li>Documents and Tangible Things. Ordinarily, a party may not discover
documents and tangible things that are prepared in anticipation of
litigation or for trial by or for another party or its representative
(including the other party’s attorney, consultant, surety, indemnitor,
insurer, or agent).</li>

<p>Rule 26(b)(3) allows a court to order disclosure when the requesting
party can show a “substantial need” for the material and an inability to
procure equivalent information “without undue hardship.” When a court
orders disclosure under this exception, however, it must still “protect
against disclosure of the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or
legal theories of a party’s attorney or other representative concerning
the litigation.” This type of work product, which is often described as
opinion work product, “is virtually undiscoverable.”</p>
<p class="case-h2">
B. The Deloitte Memorandum
</p>
<p>The government makes two categorical arguments that the Deloitte
Memorandum cannot be work product. First, it argues that the Deloitte
Memorandum cannot be work product because it was created by Deloitte,
not Dow or its representative. Second, it argues that the Deloitte
Memorandum cannot be work product because it was generated as part of
the routine audit process, not in anticipation of litigation. If either
argument is correct, the Deloitte Memorandum cannot be work product,
regardless of its contents. We reject both arguments, but nevertheless
conclude that the district court lacked sufficient information to
determine that the entire Deloitte Memorandum is work product.</p>
<p><em>1</em></p>
<p>The government first contends that Dow cannot claim work-product
protection for the Deloitte Memorandum because it was prepared by
Deloitte. Rule 26(b)(3) only protects “documents and tangible things
that are prepared by or for another party or its representative.” Given
this language, the government argues that the Deloitte Memorandum is not
work product because Deloitte is not Dow’s representative. It relies
principally on <em>United States v. Arthur Young &amp; Co.</em>, in
which the Supreme Court refused to recognize an accountant work-product
privilege. In <em>Arthur Young</em>, the Court contrasted the role of an
attorney with that of an accountant, explaining that an attorney is “a
loyal representative whose duty it is to present the client’s case in
the most favorable possible light,” whereas an independent certified
public accountant has a “public responsibility” and “owes ultimate
allegiance to the corporation’s creditors and stockholders, as well as
to the investing public.” In the government’s view, <em>Arthur
Young</em> demonstrates that Deloitte cannot be Dow’s representative,
which in turn means that the Deloitte Memorandum cannot be work product
under the plain language of Rule 26(b)(3). Dow counters that the
“representative” for purposes of Rule 26(b)(3) is its counsel, whose
thoughts and opinions are recorded in the document. In addition, it
argues that the Deloitte Memorandum is work product because it contains
the same type of opinion work product that is found in the Dow
Documents, which the government concedes are work product.</p>
<p>Even if the government is correct in asserting that the Deloitte
Memorandum falls outside the definition given by Rule 26(b)(3), this
does not conclusively establish that it is not work product. The
government mistakenly assumes that Rule 26(b)(3) provides an exhaustive
definition of what constitutes work product. On the contrary, Rule
26(b)(3) only partially codifies the work-product doctrine announced in
<em>Hickman</em>. Rule 26(b)(3) addresses only “documents and tangible
things,” but <em>Hickman</em>’s definition of work product extends to
“intangible” things. Moreover, in <em>Hickman</em>, the Court explained
that the attorney’s “mental impressions” were protected from discovery,
so that he could not be forced to “repeat or write out” that information
in discovery. Thus <em>Hickman</em> provides work-product protection for
intangible work product independent of Rule 26(b)(3).</p>
<p>The government focuses on Deloitte’s role in creating the document
and on its relationship to Dow. Under <em>Hickman</em>, however, the
question is not who created the document or how they are related to the
party asserting work-product protection, but whether the document
contains work product—the thoughts and opinions of counsel developed in
anticipation of litigation. The district court found that the memorandum
records those thoughts, even though Deloitte and not Dow or its attorney
committed them to paper. The work product privilege does not depend on
whether the thoughts and opinions were communicated orally or in
writing, but on whether they were prepared in anticipation of
litigation. Thus Deloitte’s preparation of the document does not exclude
the possibility that it contains Dow’s work product.</p>
<p><em>2</em></p>
<p>The government next contends that the Deloitte Memorandum cannot be
work product because it was generated during an annual audit, not
prepared in anticipation of litigation. The courts are not unanimous on
the proper test for determining whether a document was prepared “in
anticipation of litigation.” Under the test adopted by most circuits,
the question is whether the document was created “because of” the
anticipated litigation. The Fifth Circuit, however, requires that
anticipation of litigation be the “primary motivating purpose” behind
the document’s creation.</p>
<p>Like most circuits, we apply the “because of” test, asking “whether,
in light of the nature of the document and the factual situation in the
particular case, the document can fairly be said to have been prepared
or obtained because of the prospect of litigation.” In addition, while
this standard addresses a “document,” it applies equally to work product
in other forms. Thus for the Deloitte Memorandum, the question is
whether it records information prepared by Dow or its representatives
because of the prospect of litigation.</p>
<p>In the government’s view, the Deloitte Memorandum was prepared not
“because of the prospect of litigation,” but as part of the routine
audit process. The government asserts that a document’s function, not
its content, determines whether it is work product. For this proposition
the government relies on <em>Delaney, Migdail &amp; Young, Chartered v.
IRS</em>. In <em>Delaney</em>, a law firm sought to obtain under the
Freedom of Information Act memoranda and supporting documents relating
to the government’s legal analysis of an Internal Revenue Service
program concerning the use of statistical sampling in auditing large
accounts. In that case it was the IRS that asserted work-product
protection. The court held that the documents were work product because
they “advised the agency of the types of legal challenges likely to be
mounted against a proposed program, potential defenses available to the
agency, and the likely outcome.” In its reasoning, the court noted that
a previous work-product decision had identified “the function of the
documents as the critical issue.” The government seizes on this
language, arguing that the Deloitte Memorandum is not work product
because its function was to facilitate Deloitte’s audit, not to prepare
Dow for litigation.</p>
<p>We think the government misreads <em>Delaney</em>. While
<em>Delaney</em> used the term “function,” it was not considering any
distinction between function and content in determining whether a
document constituted work product. On the contrary, the court evaluated
the function of the IRS documents at issue by examining their contents.
It contrasted the documents at issue in the <em>Coastal States</em>
case, which were like “an agency manual, fleshing out the meaning of the
statute it was authorized to enforce,” with the documents at issue in
<em>Delaney</em>, which were memoranda describing potential legal
challenges, possible defenses, and likely outcomes. <em>Delaney</em>
does not support the proposition that we should look solely to a
document’s function divorced from its contents in determining its status
as work product.</p>
<p>In short, a document can contain protected work-product material even
though it serves multiple purposes, so long as the protected material
was prepared because of the prospect of litigation.</p>
<p><em>3</em></p>
<p>Rejecting the government’s categorical arguments establishes only
that the Deloitte Memorandum may be protected work product under the
law; we must now determine whether it is. On examination of the record,
we conclude that the district court did not have a sufficient
evidentiary foundation for its holding that the memorandum was purely
work product. According to the record, the document was created during
Deloitte’s preparation of an audit report which in Deloitte’s view
required consideration of potential litigation. The meeting generating
the document included both Deloitte and Dow employees, as well as Dow’s
outside counsel. The document itself was prepared by a third party.
While none of this negates the possibility of work-product privilege, it
could make it likely that the document includes other information that
is not work product. According to Dow’s privilege log and the Curry
declaration, the memorandum does contain thoughts and analyses by legal
counsel, but this does not rule out or even render unlikely the
possibility that it also includes other facts, other thoughts, other
analyses by non-attorneys which may not be so intertwined with the legal
analysis as to warrant protection under the work-product doctrine. We
will therefore remand this question to the district court for the
purpose of independently assessing whether the document was entirely
work product, or whether a partial or redacted version of the document
could have been disclosed. Accordingly, we vacate the district court’s
decision that the Deloitte Memorandum was work product and remand so
that the district court can examine the document in camera to determine
whether it is entirely work product.</p>
<p class="case-h2">
C. The Dow Documents
</p>
<p>Although the government concedes that the Dow Documents are work
product, it contends that Dow waived work-product protection by
disclosing them to Deloitte. To the best of our knowledge, no circuit
has addressed whether disclosing work product to an independent auditor
constitutes waiver. Among the district courts that have addressed this
issue, most have found no waiver.</p>
<p>While voluntary disclosure waives the attorney-client privilege, it
does not necessarily waive work-product protection. The attorney-client
privilege and the work-product doctrine serve different purposes: the
former protects the attorney-client relationship by safeguarding
confidential communications, whereas the latter promotes the adversary
process by insulating an attorney’s litigation preparation from
discovery. Voluntary disclosure waives the attorney-client privilege
because it is inconsistent with the confidential attorney-client
relationship. Voluntary disclosure does not necessarily waive
work-product protection, however, because it does not necessarily
undercut the adversary process. Nevertheless, disclosing work product to
a third party can waive protection if “such disclosure, under the
circumstances, is inconsistent with the maintenance of secrecy from the
disclosing party’s adversary.” Under this standard, the voluntary
disclosure of attorney work product to an adversary or a conduit to an
adversary waives work-product protection for that material.</p>
<p>Applying this standard, the government contends that Dow has waived
work-product protection for the Dow Documents because Deloitte is (1) a
potential adversary and (2) a conduit to other adversaries. We reject
both contentions and conclude that Dow has not waived the
protection.</p>
<p><em>1</em></p>
<p>The government contends that Deloitte is a potential adversary of Dow
because disputes sometimes arise between independent auditors and their
clients and because independent auditors have the power to issue
opinions that adversely affect their clients. Neither argument
demonstrates that Deloitte is a potential adversary for purposes of
waiver analysis. First, as an independent auditor, Deloitte cannot be
Dow’s adversary. Even the threat of litigation between an independent
auditor and its client can compromise the auditor’s independence and
necessitate withdrawal. Further, Deloitte’s power to issue an adverse
opinion, while significant, does not make it the sort of litigation
adversary contemplated by the waiver standard. Similarly, “any tension
between an auditor and a corporation that arises from an auditor’s need
to scrutinize and investigate a corporation’s records and book-keeping
practices simply is not the equivalent of an adversarial relationship
contemplated by the work product doctrine.” Second, the possibility of a
future dispute between Deloitte and Dow does not render Deloitte a
potential adversary for the present purpose. If it did, any voluntary
disclosure would constitute waiver. Yet the work-product doctrine allows
disclosures as long as they do not undercut the adversary process.</p>
<p>Here, the question is not whether Deloitte could be Dow’s adversary
in any conceivable future litigation, but whether Deloitte could be
Dow’s adversary in the sort of litigation the Dow Documents address. We
conclude that the answer must be no. In preparing the Dow Documents, Dow
anticipated a dispute with the IRS, not a dispute with Deloitte. The
documents, which concern the tax implications of the Chemtech
partnerships, would not likely be relevant in any dispute Dow might have
with Deloitte. Thus Deloitte cannot be considered a potential adversary
with respect to the Dow Documents.</p>
<p><em>2</em></p>
<p>The government also asserts that Deloitte is a conduit to Dow’s
adversaries. It claims the district court failed to address this
question, but this ignores the district court’s explicit statement that
“no evidence suggests that it was unreasonable for Dow to expect
Deloitte USA to maintain confidentiality.” Like the district court, we
conclude that Deloitte is not a conduit to Dow’s adversaries.</p>
<p>Our prior decisions applying the “maintenance of secrecy” standard,
while fact-intensive, have generally made two discrete inquiries in
assessing whether disclosure constitutes waiver. First, we have
considered whether the disclosing party has engaged in self-interested
selective disclosure by revealing its work product to some adversaries
but not to others. Such conduct militates in favor of waiver, for it is
“inconsistent and unfair to allow parties to select according to their
own self-interest to which adversaries they will allow access to the
materials.”</p>
<p>Second, we have examined whether the disclosing party had a
reasonable basis for believing that the recipient would keep the
disclosed material confidential. A reasonable expectation of
confidentiality may derive from common litigation interests between the
disclosing party and the recipient. “The existence of common interests
between transferor and transferee is relevant to deciding whether the
disclosure is consistent with the nature of the work product privilege.”
This is true because when common litigation interests are present, “the
transferee is not at all likely to disclose the work product material to
the adversary.” Alternately, a reasonable expectation of confidentiality
may be rooted in a confidentiality agreement or similar arrangement
between the disclosing party and the recipient. Nevertheless, a
confidentiality agreement must be relatively strong and sufficiently
unqualified to avoid waiver. In <em>Williams</em>, for example, we
concluded that the government’s assurance that it would maintain
confidentiality “to the extent possible” was not sufficiently strong or
sufficiently unqualified to prevent the government from disclosing the
information to a criminal defendant under <em>Brady v. Maryland</em>.
Likewise, we have determined that a mere promise to give the disclosing
party notice before releasing documents does not support a reasonable
expectation of confidentiality.</p>
<p>The selective disclosure inquiry is straightforward. Selective
disclosure involves disclosing work product to at least one adversary.
As we have explained, Deloitte is not an adversary, so Dow’s disclosure
to Deloitte was not selective disclosure. The “reasonable expectation of
confidentiality” inquiry is more complicated. As to common interests,
Dow and Deloitte do not have common litigation interests in the Dow
Documents—Dow has a litigation interest in the documents because of its
interest in the Chemtech partnerships, but Deloitte has no similar
interest in the documents. Absent common interests, the question is
whether a confidentiality agreement or similar assurance gave Dow a
reasonable expectation that Deloitte would keep its work product
confidential.</p>
<p>We conclude that Dow had a reasonable expectation of confidentiality
because Deloitte, as an independent auditor, has an obligation to
refrain from disclosing confidential client information. Rule 301 of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Code of Professional
Conduct provides: “A member in public practice shall not disclose any
confidential client information without the specific consent of the
client.” William Curry’s declaration explains that “Dow furnished these
documents to Deloitte with the expectation that Deloitte would retain
the confidentiality of the two documents.” Given the obligation imposed
by Rule 301, we think this expectation was reasonable.</p>
<p>The government responds that this is a “‘qualified assurance’ that
does not suffice to prevent waiver because Rule 301 also explains that
it”shall not be construed to affect in any way the member’s obligation
to comply with a validly issued and enforceable subpoena or summons.”
But an assertion of work-product protection challenges the
enforceability of a subpoena with respect to those materials. Thus
Deloitte could refuse to produce the documents, thereby allowing Dow to
intervene and assert work-product protection, without violating its
obligation to comply with enforceable subpoenas. Indeed, this is exactly
what Deloitte did. Accordingly, this caveat does not significantly
diminish the reasonableness of Dow’s expectation of confidentiality.</p>
<p>The government also attempts to bolster its waiver argument by
identifying instances in which an independent auditor might disclose
information obtained from a company whose finances it audits. For
example, it asserts that Deloitte could make Dow disclose its
confidential tax analysis in footnotes to its public financial
statements. Likewise, Deloitte could testify about confidential
information obtained from Dow in proceedings brought by the SEC or
private parties. Or Deloitte might report illegal acts it detects during
its audit. Finally, the government returns to <em>Arthur Young</em>,
arguing that as an independent auditor, Deloitte is a “public watchdog”
whose ultimate allegiance is to Dow’s creditors, stockholders, and the
investing public—all potential adversaries of Dow. In sum, the
government contends that Dow could not reasonably expect confidentiality
from Deloitte after giving it the Dow Documents, given the myriad ways
Deloitte could reveal that information.</p>
<p>Of course Deloitte might disclose some information relevant to Dow’s
finances. But the government has neither pointed to any regulatory
provision nor posited any specific circumstance under which Deloitte
would be required to disclose attorney work product like that contained
in the Dow Documents. An independent auditor can fulfill its duties and
render an opinion concerning a company’s public financial statements
without revealing every piece of information it reviews during the audit
process. In short, Deloitte’s independent auditor obligations do not
make it a conduit to Dow’s adversaries.</p>
<p>Likewise, the government’s reliance on <em>Arthur Young</em> is
misplaced. In <em>Arthur Young</em>, the Court considered whether
accountant work-product should be granted the same protection attorney
work product receives. The government quotes the Court’s statement that
“To insulate from disclosure a certified public accountant’s
interpretations of the client’s financial statements would be to ignore
the significance of the accountant’s role as a disinterested analyst
charged with public obligations.” All well and good. In this case,
however, the government attempts to discover not an independent
auditor’s “interpretations of the client’s financial statements,” which
<em>Arthur Young</em> would permit, but an attorney’s thoughts and
opinions developed in anticipation of litigation, which the work-product
doctrine forbids.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we are mindful that independent auditors have
significant leverage over the companies whose finances they audit. An
auditor can essentially compel disclosure by refusing to provide an
unqualified opinion otherwise. Finding waiver based on such disclosures
could well encourage the sort of “inefficiency, unfairness and sharp
practices” that <em>Hickman</em> sought to avoid. For example, it might
discourage companies from seeking legal advice and candidly disclosing
that information to independent auditors. Moreover, the government has
not proffered any good reason for wanting the Dow Documents other than
its desire to know what Dow’s counsel thought about the Chemtech
partnerships. Granting discovery under these circumstances would
undercut the adversary process and let the government litigate “on wits
borrowed from the adversary,” We conclude that the district court
applied the correct legal standard and acted within its discretion in
determining that Dow had not waived work-product protection.
Consequently, we affirm the district court’s decision denying the
government’s motion to compel with respect to the Dow Documents.</p>

JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.
</p>
<p>We granted certiorari in this case to address important questions
concerning the scope of the attorney-client privilege in the corporate
context and the applicability of the work-product doctrine in
proceedings to enforce tax summonses. With respect to the privilege
question the parties and various amici have described our task as one of
choosing between two “tests” which have gained adherents in the courts
of appeals. We are acutely aware, however, that we sit to decide

<p class="case-h1">
I
</p>
<p>Petitioner Upjohn Co. manufactures and sells pharmaceuticals here and
abroad. In January 1976 independent accountants conducting an audit of
one of Upjohn’s foreign subsidiaries discovered that the subsidiary made
payments to or for the benefit of foreign government officials in order
to secure government business. The accountants so informed petitioner
Mr. Gerard Thomas, Upjohn’s Vice President, Secretary, and General
Counsel. Thomas is a member of the Michigan and New York Bars, and has
been Upjohn’s General Counsel for 20 years. He consulted with outside
counsel and R. T. Parfet, Jr., Upjohn’s Chairman of the Board. It was
decided that the company would conduct an internal investigation of what
were termed “questionable payments.” As part of this investigation the
attorneys prepared a letter containing a questionnaire which was sent to
“All Foreign General and Area Managers” over the Chairman’s signature.
The letter began by noting recent disclosures that several American
companies made “possibly illegal” payments to foreign government
officials and emphasized that the management needed full information
concerning any such payments made by Upjohn. The letter indicated that
the Chairman had asked Thomas, identified as “the company’s General
Counsel,” “to conduct an investigation for the purpose of determining
the nature and magnitude of any payments made by the Upjohn Company or
any of its subsidiaries to any employee or official of a foreign
government.” The questionnaire sought detailed information concerning
such payments. Managers were instructed to treat the investigation as
“highly confidential” and not to discuss it with anyone other than
Upjohn employees who might be helpful in providing the requested
information. Responses were to be sent directly to Thomas. Thomas and
outside counsel also interviewed the recipients of the questionnaire and
some 33 other Upjohn officers or employees as part of the
investigation.</p>
<p>On March 26, 1976, the company voluntarily submitted a preliminary
report to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K disclosing
certain questionable payments. A copy of the report was simultaneously
submitted to the Internal Revenue Service, which immediately began an
investigation to determine the tax consequences of the payments. Special
agents conducting the investigation were given lists by Upjohn of all
those interviewed and all who had responded to the questionnaire. On
November 23, 1976, the Service issued a summons demanding production
of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All files relative to the investigation conducted under the
supervision of Gerard Thomas to identify payments to employees of
foreign governments and any political contributions made by the Upjohn
Company or any of its affiliates since January 1, 1971 and to determine
whether any funds of the Upjohn Company had been improperly accounted
for on the corporate books during the same period. The records should
include but not be limited to written questionnaires sent to managers of
the Upjohn Company’s foreign affiliates, and memorandums or notes of the
interviews conducted in the United States and abroad with officers and
employees of the Upjohn Company and its subsidiaries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The company declined to produce the documents specified in the second
paragraph on the grounds that they were protected from disclosure by the
attorney-client privilege and constituted the work product of attorneys
prepared in anticipation of litigation. On August 31, 1977, the United
States filed a petition seeking enforcement of the summons in the United
States District Court for the Western District of Michigan. That court
adopted the recommendation of a Magistrate who concluded that the
summons should be enforced. Petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals
for the Sixth Circuit which rejected the Magistrate’s finding of a
waiver of the attorney-client privilege, but agreed that the privilege
did not apply “to the extent that the communications were made by
officers and agents not responsible for directing Upjohn’s actions in
response to legal advice for the simple reason that the communications
were not the ‘client’s.’” The court reasoned that accepting petitioners’
claim for a broader application of the privilege would encourage
upper-echelon management to ignore unpleasant facts and create too broad
a “zone of silence.” Noting that Upjohn’s counsel had interviewed
officials such as the Chairman and President, the Court of Appeals
remanded to the District Court so that a determination of who was within
the “control group” could be made. In a concluding footnote the court
stated that the work-product doctrine “is not applicable to
administrative summonses.”</p>
<p class="case-h1">
II
</p>
<p>Federal Rule of Evidence 501 provides that “the privilege of a
witness shall be governed by the principles of the common law as they
may be interpreted by the courts of the United States in light of reason
and experience.” The attorney-client privilege is the oldest of the
privileges for confidential communications known to the common law. Its
purpose is to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys
and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the
observance of law and administration of justice. The privilege
recognizes that sound legal advice or advocacy serves public ends and
that such advice or advocacy depends upon the lawyer’s being fully
informed by the client. “The lawyer-client privilege rests on the need
for the advocate and counselor to know all that relates to the client’s
reasons for seeking representation if the professional mission is to be
carried out.” The purpose of the privilege is “to encourage clients to
make full disclosure to their attorneys.” This rationale for the
privilege has long been recognized by the Court. Admittedly
complications in the application of the privilege arise when the client
is a corporation, which in theory is an artificial creature of the law,
and not an individual; but this Court has assumed that the privilege
applies when the client is a corporation, and the Government does not
contest the general proposition.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals, however, considered the application of the
privilege in the corporate context to present a “different problem,”
since the client was an inanimate entity and “only the senior
management, guiding and integrating the several operations, can be said
to possess an identity analogous to the corporation as a whole.”</p>
<p>Such a view, we think, overlooks the fact that the privilege exists
to protect not only the giving of professional advice to those who can
act on it but also the giving of information to the lawyer to enable him
to give sound and informed advice. The first step in the resolution of
any legal problem is ascertaining the factual background and sifting
through the facts with an eye to the legally relevant. See ABA Code of
Professional Responsibility, Ethical Consideration 4-1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lawyer should be fully informed of all the facts of the matter he
is handling in order for his client to obtain the full advantage of our
legal system. It is for the lawyer in the exercise of his independent
professional judgment to separate the relevant and important from the
irrelevant and unimportant. The observance of the ethical obligation of
a lawyer to hold inviolate the confidences and secrets of his client not
only facilitates the full development of facts essential to proper
representation of the client but also encourages laymen to seek early
legal assistance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the case of the individual client the provider of information and
the person who acts on the lawyer’s advice are one and the same. In the
corporate context, however, it will frequently be employees beyond the
control group as defined by the court below—“officers and agents
responsible for directing the company’s actions in response to legal
advice” —who will possess the information needed by the corporation’s
lawyers. Middle-level—and indeed lower-level—employees can, by actions
within the scope of their employment, embroil the corporation in serious
legal difficulties, and it is only natural that these employees would
have the relevant information needed by corporate counsel if he is
adequately to advise the client with respect to such actual or potential
difficulties.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a corporation, it may be necessary to glean information relevant
to a legal problem from middle management or non-management personnel as
well as from top executives. The attorney dealing with a complex legal
problem “is thus faced with a ‘Hobson’s choice’. If he interviews
employees not having ‘the very highest authority’, their communications
to him will not be privileged. If, on the other hand, he interviews only
those employees with ‘the very highest authority’, he may find it
extremely difficult, if not impossible, to determine what happened.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The control group test adopted by the court below thus frustrates the
very purpose of the privilege by discouraging the communication of
relevant information by employees of the client to attorneys seeking to
render legal advice to the client corporation. The attorney’s advice
will also frequently be more significant to noncontrol group members
than to those who officially sanction the advice, and the control group
test makes it more difficult to convey full and frank legal advice to
the employees who will put into effect the client corporation’s
policy.</p>
<p>The narrow scope given the attorney-client privilege by the court
below not only makes it difficult for corporate attorneys to formulate
sound advice when their client is faced with a specific legal problem
but also threatens to limit the valuable efforts of corporate counsel to
ensure their client’s compliance with the law. In light of the vast and
complicated array of regulatory legislation confronting the modern
corporation, corporations, unlike most individuals, “constantly go to
lawyers to find out how to obey the law,” particularly since compliance
with the law in this area is hardly an instinctive matter. The test
adopted by the court below is difficult to apply in practice, though no
abstractly formulated and unvarying “test” will necessarily enable
courts to decide questions such as this with mathematical precision. But
if the purpose of the attorney-client privilege is to be served, the
attorney and client must be able to predict with some degree of
certainty whether particular discussions will be protected. An uncertain
privilege, or one which purports to be certain but results in widely
varying applications by the courts, is little better than no privilege
at all. The very terms of the test adopted by the court below suggest
the unpredictability of its application. The test restricts the
availability of the privilege to those officers who play a “substantial
role” in deciding and directing a corporation’s legal response.
Disparate decisions in cases applying this test illustrate its
unpredictability.</p>
<p>The communications at issue were made by Upjohn employees to counsel
for Upjohn acting as such, at the direction of corporate superiors in
order to secure legal advice from counsel. As the Magistrate found,
“Mr. Thomas consulted with the Chairman of the Board and outside counsel
and thereafter conducted a factual investigation to determine the nature
and extent of the questionable payments and to be in a position to give
legal advice to the company with respect to the payments.” Information,
not available from upper-echelon management, was needed to supply a
basis for legal advice concerning compliance with securities and tax
laws, foreign laws, currency regulations, duties to shareholders, and
potential litigation in each of these areas. The communications
concerned matters within the scope of the employees’ corporate duties,
and the employees themselves were sufficiently aware that they were
being questioned in order that the corporation could obtain legal
advice. The questionnaire identified Thomas as “the company’s General
Counsel” and referred in its opening sentence to the possible illegality
of payments such as the ones on which information was sought. A
statement of policy accompanying the questionnaire clearly indicated the
legal implications of the investigation. The policy statement was issued
“in order that there be no uncertainty in the future as to the policy
with respect to the practices which are the subject of this
investigation.” It began “Upjohn will comply with all laws and
regulations,” and stated that commissions or payments “will not be used
as a subterfuge for bribes or illegal payments” and that all payments
must be “proper and legal.” Any future agreements with foreign
distributors or agents were to be approved “by a company attorney” and
any questions concerning the policy were to be referred “to the
company’s General Counsel.” This statement was issued to Upjohn
employees worldwide, so that even those interviewees not receiving a
questionnaire were aware of the legal implications of the interviews.
Pursuant to explicit instructions from the Chairman of the Board, the
communications were considered “highly confidential” when made, and have
been kept confidential by the company. Consistent with the underlying
purposes of the attorney-client privilege, these communications must be
protected against compelled disclosure.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals declined to extend the attorney-client privilege
beyond the limits of the control group test for fear that doing so would
entail severe burdens on discovery and create a broad “zone of silence”
over corporate affairs. Application of the attorney-client privilege to
communications such as those involved here, however, puts the adversary
in no worse position than if the communications had never taken place.
The privilege only protects disclosure of communications; it does not
protect disclosure of the underlying facts by those who communicated
with the attorney:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The protection of the privilege extends only to communications and
not to facts. A fact is one thing and a communication concerning that
fact is an entirely different thing. The client cannot be compelled to
answer the question, “What did you say or write to the attorney?” but
may not refuse to disclose any relevant fact within his knowledge merely
because he incorporated a statement of such fact into his communications
to his attorney.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the Government was free to question the employees who
communicated with Thomas and outside counsel. Upjohn has provided the
IRS with a list of such employees, and the IRS has already interviewed
some 25 of them. While it would probably be more convenient for the
Government to secure the results of petitioner’s internal investigation
by simply subpoenaing the questionnaires and notes taken by petitioner’s
attorneys, such considerations of convenience do not overcome the
policies served by the attorney-client privilege. As Justice Jackson
noted in his concurring opinion in <em>Hickman v. Taylor</em>:
“Discovery was hardly intended to enable a learned profession to perform
its functions on wits borrowed from the adversary.”</p>
<p>Needless to say, we decide only the case before us, and do not
undertake to draft a set of rules which should govern challenges to
investigatory subpoenas. Any such approach would violate the spirit of
Federal Rule of Evidence 501. While such a “case-by-case” basis may to
some slight extent undermine desirable certainty in the boundaries of
the attorney-client privilege, it obeys the spirit of the Rules. At the
same time we conclude that the narrow “control group test” sanctioned by
the Court of Appeals in this case cannot, consistent with “the
principles of the common law as interpreted in the light of reason and
experience,” govern the development of the law in this area.</p>

<h4>Matter of Bevill, Bresler &amp; Schulman Asset Manag., 805 F.2d 120
(3d Cir. 1986)</h4>
<p class="case-h1">
SEITZ, Circuit Judge.
</p>
<p>This appeal arises out of two related proceedings currently before
the district court: the Chapter 11 reorganization of Bevill, Bresler
&amp; Schulman Asset Management Corporation (AMC) and the liquidation of
Bevill, Bresler &amp; Schulman, Inc. (BBS) under the Security Investor
Protection Act (SIPA). Intervenors John D. Rooney and Robert L. Bevill,
two principals of the corporations, appeal the order of the district
court directing Gilbert Schulman, president of AMC, and Hellring,
Lindeman, Goldstein, Siegal &amp; Greenberg, counsel for BBS, to respond
to questions posed in depositions by the trustees for AMC and BBS. The
order permits the trustees to discover the substance of certain meetings
that took place between the law firm and the principals of the
corporations before the Chapter 11 petition was filed. Because Rooney
and Bevill allege that the district court’s order violates their
attorney-client privilege, we have jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
I.
</p>
<p>We turn first to the facts as narrated by the district court. Gilbert
Schulman first became aware that AMC was in financial difficulties on
March 19, 1985, when Robert Bevill telephoned him in Greece. After
talking again with Bevill on the following day, Schulman flew back to
the United States. According to Schulman, he was unable to obtain any
information about AMC until he consulted with Hellring, Lindeman on
March 25, 1985.</p>
<p>Between March 25, 1985 and April 7, 1985, Schulman met with Hellring,
Lindeman almost daily. Other principals of BBS and AMC, including Bevill
and Rooney, were present at some of these meetings.</p>
<p>When Schulman first met with Hellring, Lindeman, he explained that he
was seeking both personal and corporate legal advice. In his deposition,
he testified that with regard to the March 26th meeting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I stated to Mr. Hellring and Mr. Goldstein that I had arranged for
Mr. Bevill to come down and meet them and at that point I had said to
them that “Possibly you will represent me, possibly you will represent
Mr. Bevill and me, possibly you will represent the firms,” but I was
definitely seeking personal legal advice at that time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On March 31, 1985, Hellring, Lindeman was retained to represent BBS.
In addition, it continued to consider whether it would represent the
principals of BBS. On April 4, 1985, Hellring, Lindeman informed the
principals that they should obtain separate counsel.</p>
<p>On April 7, 1985, AMC filed a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter
11 of the Bankruptcy Code. A trustee was subsequently appointed by the
district court. On April 8, the SEC filed a civil complaint in the
district court alleging fraud against AMC, BBS, and the principals of
the corporations, including appellants. In addition, the SEC began a
criminal investigation, and there is currently a grand jury
investigation into the affairs of the two corporations. On May 8, the
district court placed BBS under a SIPA receivership and the SIPA trustee
commenced a liquidation proceeding.</p>
<p>On May 13, 1985, the counsel for the AMC trustee began to depose
Schulman. By the consent of the parties, this deposition was conducted
as a joint proceeding in the AMC Chapter 11 proceeding, the BBS SIPA
liquidation, and the SEC proceeding. The AMC trustee sought to depose
Schulman as to the substantive communications between Hellring, Lindeman
and the principals, and indicated that the trustee had waived AMC’s
attorney-client privilege. Schulman’s counsel instructed Schulman not to
answer the questions. Counsel for the other principals also instructed
Schulman not to respond, asserting the existence of a joint defense
privilege.</p>
<p>On May 21, 1985, the deposition of Schulman resumed, and the AMC
trustee began questioning Schulman about the circumstances surrounding
the meetings with counsel, including the dates of the meetings, who was
present, and whether the discussions involved personal or corporate
matters. Once again, counsel for the other principals objected on the
grounds of a joint defense privilege.</p>
<p>The AMC and BBS trustees and the SEC subsequently filed motions with
the district court for an order directing the principals and Hellring
Lindeman to respond to a series of questions as to the circumstances
surrounding the meetings. In opposition to these motions, Rooney filed
an unsworn affirmation with the district court stating that he met with
counsel for personal advice and with the expectation that the
communications would be confidential. He further stated that he would
not have met with counsel without the assurance of confidentiality.</p>
<p>After a hearing, the district court ordered Bevill, Rooney, Schulman,
Robert Levine, another principal, and Hellring, Lindeman to answer
written interrogatories about the scope of counsel’s representation.
Bevill and Rooney refused to answer the interrogatories on the ground of
the fifth amendment. Schulman stated that he attended all meetings
except the March 31st meeting for the purpose of securing personal legal
advice. Levine concurred in this statement, and also stated that the
participants in the meetings were engaged in a joint defense effort.
Schulman, however, has asserted in a letter to the BBS trustee from his
counsel that he was never part of a joint defense.</p>
<p>Hellring, Lindeman confirmed in their answers to the interrogatories
that the principals had sought both personal and corporate legal advice
at the meetings that occurred from March 25th through April 4th. In a
letter to the BBS trustee, it further explained its understanding of its
representation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our firm was initially consulted on Monday, March 25, 1985. On that
date and during the week of March 25, 1985 we were consulted by
officials of Bevill, Bresler &amp; Schulman, Inc. on a confidential and
privileged basis for the purpose of personal representation as well as
corporate representation of Bevill, Bresler &amp; Schulman, Inc. and
other companies. We were not retained until Sunday, March 31, 1985 on
which date we agreed to represent Bevill, Bresler &amp; Schulman, the
broker/dealer and its affiliated broker/dealer companies and to consider
further the matter of representation for the individuals and other
corporations. During the next few days we continued to be consulted by
officials of Bevill, Bresler &amp; Schulman, Inc. on a confidential and
privileged basis for purposes of personal representation and to consider
the need therefor. Within a few days of March 31, 1985 we advised each
individual official to retain separate and individual counsel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The trustees, relying on their waiver of the corporations’
attorney-client privileges, moved for an order directing Schulman and
Hellring, Lindeman to testify about the substance of the meetings
insofar as they related to the affairs of the two corporations and
Schulman’s activities as a director or officer of the corporations.
Bevill and Rooney opposed the motions based on their attorney-client
privileges and a joint defense privilege.</p>
<p>After hearing argument from counsel on the trustees’ motions, the
district court, in an oral opinion, granted the motions in part. The
court held that a corporate officer must satisfy the following test to
assert a personal claim of attorney-client privilege as to
communications with corporate counsel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, they must show they approached counsel for the purpose of
seeking legal advice. Second, they must demonstrate that when they
approached counsel they made it clear that they were seeking legal
advice in their individual rather than in their representative
capacities. Third, they must demonstrate that the counsel saw fit to
communicate with them in their individual capacities, knowing that a
possible conflict could arise. Fourth, they must prove that their
conversations with counsel were confidential. And, fifth, they must show
that the substance of their conversations with counsel did not concern
matters within the company or the general affairs of the company.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The court rejected Rooney’s claim that he consulted with counsel for
the sole or primary purpose of securing personal legal advice, finding
such a claim unsupported by the evidence. It then turned to the
principals’ contention that the corporate communications were
indistinguishable from those that related to their personal legal
problems, and that, therefore, all communications are privileged. The
court agreed with Bevill and Rooney insofar as the trustees sought to
obtain information about meetings prior to March 31st when Hellring,
Lindeman agreed to represent BBS. The court thus held that these
communications were privileged. The trustees do not appeal this
ruling.</p>
<p>It, however, rejected the appellants claim of a blanket privilege for
those meetings that occurred after March 31st. It found that once
Hellring, Lindeman agreed to represent BBS, it was to BBS that the
lawyers owed any duty. Further, based on counsel’s knowledge of BBS and
AMC when the bankruptcy petition was filed, the court found that “it is
obvious that immediately after March 31, 1985, Hellring, Lindeman turned
its attention to the affairs of its corporate clients.” Finally, the
court stated that the only personal advice that had been identified was
that relating to separate representation.</p>
<p>The court also rejected Bevill’s and Rooney’s claim of a joint
defense privilege, finding that they did not bear their burden of
showing that a joint defense in fact existed.</p>
<p>The district court ordered Hellring, Lindeman to testify as to all
communications about the corporations and the roles and functions of the
officers that took place after the law firm agreed to represent BBS. It
further held that no questions could be asked concerning separate
representation or the officers’ potential personal liabilities, unless
the communications also related to the business and assets of the
corporations or the roles of the principals in the corporations.
Finally, the court stated that Hellring, Lindeman could submit any
communications it was doubtful about to the court for in camera
inspection. This appeal followed.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
II.
</p>
<p>Bevill and Rooney claim that the district court’s order directing
disclosure of the substantive communications with counsel between March
31st and April 4th violates their attorney-client privilege. In
addition, Bevill claims that such disclosure is barred by the joint
defense privilege.</p>
<p>Privileges in federal court are “governed by the principles of common
law as they may be interpreted in light of reason and experience.”
Whether there is a valid claim of privilege is decided on a case-by-case
basis. Although the applicability of a privilege is a factual question,
determining the scope of a privilege is a question of law, subject to
plenary review.</p>
<p class="case-h2">
A.
</p>
<p>The purpose of the attorney-client privilege “is to encourage full
and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby
promote broader public interests in observance of the law and
administration of justice.” This privilege applies to corporations as
well as individuals. As the Supreme Court has recognized, however, “the
administration of the privilege in the case of corporations presents
special problems. As an inanimate entity, a corporation must act through
agents.”</p>
<p>In this case, we address the relationship between a corporation’s
waiver of its privilege and the individual directors’ assertion of a
claim of personal attorney-client privilege with respect to counsel
consulted on both a personal and corporate basis after the counsel has
been retained by the corporation. The parties agree that the trustees
had the power to waive the corporations’ attorney-client privilege
regarding prebankruptcy communications with counsel. They also agree
that the directors or officers may have an individual attorney-client
privilege apart from those of the corporations. The dispute centers on
whether the individuals’ assertion of an attorney-client privilege can
prevent the disclosure of corporate communications with corporate
counsel when the corporation’s privilege has been waived.</p>
<p>As we understand appellants’ position, they claim that the district
court erred as a matter of law in holding that communications related to
their role as corporate officers were not privileged. They contend that
because their personal legal problems were inextricably intertwined with
those of the corporation, disclosure of discussions of corporate matters
would eviscerate their personal privileges. They therefore assert that a
blanket privilege should be applied to all communications with counsel
between March 31st and April 4th.</p>
<p>The appellants’ argument, however, does not pay sufficient attention
to the fact that under existing law, any privilege that exists as to a
corporate officer’s role and functions within a corporation belongs to
the corporation, not the officer. Because a corporation can act only
through its agents, a corporation’s privilege consists of communications
by corporate officials about corporate matters and their actions in the
corporation. A corporate official thus may not prevent a corporation
from waiving its privilege arising from discussions with corporate
counsel about corporate matters.</p>
<p>The two decisions cited by appellants, <em>In re Citibank v.
Andros</em> and <em>Diversified Industries, Inc. v. Meredith</em>, do
not support their position that they may assert their personal privilege
over the corporation’s waiver with regard to corporate matters. Rather,
these two cases simply recognize that an individual officer may have an
individual claim of attorney-client privilege with regard to
communications with corporate counsel.</p>
<p>Moreover, we find that appellants’ position is contrary to the public
policies identified by the Supreme Court. The <em>Weintraub</em> Court
found that permitting a bankrupt corporations’ management to assert the
corporation’s privilege against the bankruptcy trustee would defeat the
Bankruptcy Code’s goal of uncovering insider fraud. To provide a blanket
privilege regarding all discussions of corporate matters on the basis of
an assertion of personal privileges by the officers would prevent the
trustee from investigating possible misconduct by the officers and
permit the officers to “use the privilege as a shield against the
trustee’s efforts.”</p>
<p>The test adopted by the district court does not invade the personal
privilege of the officers because they do not have an attorney-client
privilege with regard to communications made in their role as corporate
officials. Moreover, the district court has not precluded the
possibility that appellants may assert their personal privilege as to
matters not related to their role as officers of the corporation. First,
the order directs that no questions could be asked regarding the need
for separate representation. Second, the court allowed for the
possibility that appellants could demonstrate that some of the
communications after March 31st were personal and protected
communications relating to the principals’ personal liabilities, except
insofar as they were related to their role as corporate officers.
Finally, the district court held that it would review <em>in camera</em>
any communication over which there was a question whether it was
personal or corporate in nature.</p>
<p>In light of the foregoing analysis, we find that the district court’s
order properly defined the extent to which the principals were entitled
to bar discovery of communications with counsel based on their
individual attorney-client privileges.</p>

<h4>FTC v. GlaxoSmithKline, 294 F. 3d 141 (D.C. Cir. 2002)</h4>
<p class="case-h1">
GINSBURG, Chief Judge
</p>
<p>In the course of investigating whether a manufacturer of drugs listed
its patents properly in the compilation maintained by the Food and Drug
Administration, the Federal Trade Commission issued a subpoena directing
the company to produce documents relating to a particular drug. When the
company resisted, claiming the attorney-client privilege shields the
documents, the Commission repaired to the district court, which enforced
the subpoena. We reverse the decision of the district court because the
court both relied upon an argument to which the company had no
opportunity to respond and ruled erroneously that, by failing to keep
confidential the contents of the documents, the company had waived the
attorney-client privilege.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
I. Background
</p>
<p>GlaxoSmithKline manufactures paroxteine hydrochloride hemihydrate
under the brand name Paxil, the annual sales of which in the United
States exceed $1 billion. Several companies have applied to the Food and
Drug Administration for permission to sell generic versions of Paxil
when GSK’s patents expire. The Federal Trade Commission is investigating
whether GSK, in an attempt to prevent or delay competition from generic
versions of Paxil, has abused the process for listing its patents in the
FDA’s compilation of “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic
Evaluations.”</p>
<p>The Commission issued a subpoena directing GSK to produce two types
of documents. First, the Commission sought all documents concerning
Paxil that the United States District Court for the Northern District of
Illinois had directed GSK to disclose when GSK had sued two
manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals for infringement of its
patents—the so-called Chicago documents. Second, the Commission wanted
all “documents related to the manufacturing and marketing of Paxil, the
listing and use of any patents regarding Paxil, and any filings with the
FDA regarding Paxil.” GSK and the Commission resolved their differences
over the inclusion or exclusion of thousands of documents, but because
GSK declined to produce hundreds of others—primarily on the ground that
they were shielded by the attorney-client privilege—the Commission
petitioned the district court to enforce the subpoena.</p>
<p>The parties then agreed upon a procedure for presenting their
positions to the district court. First, each would submit its
contentions about the Chicago documents. If the court compelled GSK to
produce those documents, then the parties would contest the second
category of documents as follows. The Commission would “identify for GSK
every responsive (and allegedly privileged) document that the Commission
sought to have produced and the reason(s) why each privilege claim was
invalid.” GSK would then either produce the document or list it in a
“privilege log identifying any documents as to which it continued to
assert privilege.” Accordingly, only after the Commission had informed
GSK of its objections to the Company’s claims of privilege would the
parties seek judicial resolution. At that final stage the court would
either call for oral argument or resolve summarily “any issues submitted
to it in connection with the FTC’s enforcement petition.”</p>
<p>The district court did enforce the subpoena with respect to the
Chicago documents. The parties then resolved through negotiation their
disputes about the disclosure of hundreds more documents, leaving
unresolved the status of only 91. GSK asserted that all 91 documents
were protected by the attorney-client privilege and that 34 of them were
protected also by the privilege for attorney work product. The
Commission told GSK it considered the assertions of privilege invalid
for two reasons: (1) GSK had forfeited its claim to confidentiality by
disseminating all 91 documents widely both within GSK and to consultants
and other third-parties; and (2) the decision in <em>Apotex</em>
estopped GSK from asserting that the 34 documents were attorney work
product, that is, were prepared in anticipation of litigation. In
response to these objections, GSK compiled a privilege log describing
each of the 91 documents, and the parties presented their arguments to
the district court.</p>
<p>In its opening brief to the district court, the Commission raised the
two objections it had previously presented to GSK. The Commission also
introduced in that brief a new argument: Regardless whether
<em>Apotex</em> foreclosed the Company’s claim of attorney work product,
GSK’s privilege log “failed to provide facts demonstrating that the
documents were created in anticipation of litigation.” When GSK objected
that the Commission had not made this argument during pre-motion
negotiations, the Commission withdrew the argument. It explained in a
Stipulation approved by the district court that it had “inadvertently
failed to provide GSK with the agreed advance notice regarding the
grounds for challenging the documents.”</p>
<p>GSK submitted its responsive brief to the district court and attached
thereto the Company’s privilege log and the affidavit of Charles Kinzig,
GSK’s Vice President and Director of Corporate Intellectual Property.
For each document, the log described the contents; listed the author,
intended recipients, and date of creation; and noted whether the author
or intended recipients were attorneys. A supplement to the log indicated
the title or titles of each person therein named who was not an
attorney. The Kinzig Declaration stated that the documents had been
disseminated to various “teams” of company employees and contractors,
and explained the duties of each team. According to Kinzig, all the
teams were “involved in seeking or giving legal advice and/or gathering
and recording information in anticipation of or preparation for
litigation.” The Kinzig Declaration states also that every employee and
contractor named in the privilege log was “bound not to disclose
confidential information to persons outside GSK” without receiving
permission from a high-ranking official of the Company.</p>
<p>The Commission then filed a reply brief in which it made yet another
argument for the first time: The attorney-client privilege does not
shield the documents because they contain no confidential
information.</p>
<p>The district court ordered GSK to produce the 91 documents. The court
rejected GSK’s claims of attorney-client privilege on the grounds that
(1) “GSK had not sustained its burden of demonstrating that the relevant
documents were distributed on a ‘need to know’ basis or to employees
that were ‘authorized to speak or act’ for GSK,” and (2) the Company had
“failed to provide sufficient evidence that the information contained
therein is confidential.” The court rejected GSK’s claims of attorney
work product for the reason withdrawn by the Commission, namely, that
“GSK failed to set forth objective facts that support the corporation’s
assertion that the relevant documents were created in anticipation of
litigation.” Having determined that “even if GSK is not precluded from
asserting the privilege for attorney work product, it has failed to
satisfy its burden of showing the applicability of the doctrine to the
relevant documents,” the district court found it unnecessary to resolve
whether the decision in Apotex estopped GSK from claiming otherwise. GSK
sought and we granted a stay pending appeal.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
II. Analysis
</p>
<p>GSK contends the district court erred both by rejecting its claims of
privilege based upon arguments the Commission did not raise properly and
by misapplying the standard for determining whether a corporation has
kept confidential the contents of a communication. The Commission
defends the decision of the district court and argues that GSK is
collaterally estopped in any event, by reason of the <em>Apotex</em>
litigation, from claiming the 34 documents are attorney work
product.</p>
<p>The district court held that GSK failed to establish either of two
prerequisites for recognition of the attorney-client privilege—that the
documents contain confidential information and that they have been kept
confidential. As the Company points out, during the parties’
negotiations the Commission did not dispute that the documents contain
confidential information. The Commission did not even raise the argument
in its opening brief before the district court, waiting instead until
its reply brief and thereby depriving GSK of any opportunity to
respond.</p>
<p>The Commission had agreed, pursuant to the Scheduling Stipulation
approved by the district court, to inform GSK of its reasons for
disputing the Company’s claims of privilege before asking the court for
a ruling. The Commission therefore was bound not to put before the
district court any objection not first raised with its adversary.
Accordingly, the district court abused its discretion when it ruled
against GSK based upon an argument that was raised not only in violation
of the Scheduling Stipulation but so belatedly that the Company had no
chance to respond to it.</p>
<p>The question that remains is whether the district court erred in
ruling that GSK failed to satisfy the second prerequisite for
attorney-client privilege—that the documents have been kept
confidential. GSK contends that this issue, too, was raised in a manner
that deprived the Company of an opportunity to respond. We think not.
The Commission took the position in its negotiations with GSK that the
Company had lost its claim of privilege by disseminating the documents
widely. This argument put the Company on notice that it needed to
establish it had kept the documents confidential. The Commission renewed
the point in its opening brief to the district court thus: “In view of
the breadth of distribution and GSK’s failure to carry its burden of
establishing that each and every recipient had a demonstrable ‘need to
know,’ GSK’s assertions of attorney-client privilege must fail.” And the
Company joined this argument on the merits before the district court.
Having defended as sufficient the evidence it submitted to the district
court on this point, GSK may not now claim it was unfairly surprised by
the argument.</p>
<p>Although the district court was correct to entertain the Commission’s
second argument, it erred in resolving the legal issue. The applicable
standard is, as the district court recognized, whether “the documents
were distributed on a ‘need to know’ basis or to employees that were
‘authorized to speak or act’ for the company.” The Company’s privilege
log and the affidavit of Charles Kinzig establish that GSK circulated
the documents in question only to specifically named employees and
contractors, most of whom were attorneys or managers and all of whom
“needed to provide input to the legal department and/or receive the
legal advice and strategies formulated by counsel.” The affidavit also
states that each intended recipient was bound by corporate policy or, in
the case of the contractors, by a separate understanding, to keep
confidential the contents of the documents. The Company’s submission
thus leads ineluctably to the conclusion that no document was
“disseminated beyond those persons who, because of the corporate
structure, needed to know its contents.”</p>
<p>The district court faulted GSK for not having explained “why any, let
alone all, of the employees received copies of certain documents,” and
the Commission likewise claims on brief that GSK should have shown why
each individual in possession of a confidential document “needed the
information therein to carry out his/her work.” These demands are
overreaching. The Company’s burden is to show that it limited its
dissemination of the documents in keeping with their asserted
confidentiality, not to justify each determination that a particular
employee should have access to the information therein. Not only would
that task be Herculean—especially when the sender and the recipient are
no longer with the Company—but it is wholly unnecessary. After all, when
a corporation provides a confidential document to certain specified
employees or contractors with the admonition not to disseminate further
its contents and the contents of the documents are related generally to
the employees’ corporate duties, absent evidence to the contrary we may
reasonably infer that the information was deemed necessary for the
employees’ or contractors’ work. We do not presume, therefore, that any
business would include in a restricted circulation list a person with no
reason to have access to the confidential document—that is, one who has
no “need to know.”</p>
<p>Moreover, we can imagine no useful purpose in having a court review
the business judgment of each corporate official who deemed it necessary
or desirable for a particular employee or contractor to have access to a
corporate secret. It suffices instead that the corporation limited
dissemination to specific individuals whose corporate duties relate
generally to the contents of the documents. As we have seen in this
case, the privilege log and the Kinzig Declaration together establish
that GSK did just that, and the Company thereby demonstrated its
entitlement to the attorney-client privilege. The FTC has proffered
nothing to the contrary.</p>
<p>Our conclusion that the documents are protected by the
attorney-client privilege extends also to those communications that GSK
shared with its public relations and government affairs consultants. The
Kinzig affidavit notes that GSK’s corporate counsel “worked with these
consultants in the same manner as they did with full-time employees;
indeed, the consultants acted as part of a team with full-time employees
regarding their particular assignments” and, as a result, the
consultants “became integral members of the team assigned to deal with
issues that were completely intertwined with GSK’s litigation and legal
strategies.” In these circumstances, “there is no reason to distinguish
between a person on the corporation’s payroll and a consultant hired by
the corporation if each acts for the corporation and possesses the
information needed by attorneys in rendering legal advice.”</p>

Attorney-Client Privilege and Work Product; Limitations on Waiver
</p>
<p>The following provisions apply, in the circumstances set out, to
disclosure of a communication or information covered by the
attorney-client privilege or work-product protection.</p>
<p>(a) Disclosure Made in a Federal Proceeding or to a Federal Office or
Agency; Scope of a Waiver. When the disclosure is made in a federal
proceeding or to a federal office or agency and waives the
attorney-client privilege or work-product protection, the waiver extends
to an undisclosed communication or information in a federal or state
proceeding only if:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) the waiver is intentional;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) the disclosed and undisclosed communications or information
concern the same subject matter; and</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(3) they ought in fairness to be considered together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(b) Inadvertent Disclosure. When made in a federal proceeding or to a
federal office or agency, the disclosure does not operate as a waiver in
a federal or state proceeding if:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) the disclosure is inadvertent;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) the holder of the privilege or protection took reasonable steps
to prevent disclosure; and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(3) the holder promptly took reasonable steps to rectify the error,

<p>(c) Disclosure Made in a State Proceeding. When the disclosure is
made in a state proceeding and is not the subject of a state-court order
concerning waiver, the disclosure does not operate as a waiver in a
federal proceeding if the disclosure:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) would not be a waiver under this rule if it had been made in a
federal proceeding; or</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>(2) is not a waiver under the law of the state where the disclosure
occurred.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(d) Controlling Effect of a Court Order. A federal court may order
that the privilege or protection is not waived by disclosure connected
with the litigation pending before the court — in which event the
disclosure is also not a waiver in any other federal or state
proceeding.</p>
<p>(e) Controlling Effect of a Party Agreement. An agreement on the
effect of disclosure in a federal proceeding is binding only on the

order.</p>
<p>(f) Controlling Effect of this Rule. Notwithstanding Rules 101 and
1101, this rule applies to state proceedings and to federal
court-annexed and federal court-mandated arbitration proceedings, in the

<blockquote>
<p>(1) “attorney-client privilege” means the protection that applicable

<h4>In re Sealed Case, 877 F.2d 976 (D.C. Cir. 1989)</h4>
<p class="case-h1">
SILBERMAN, Circuit Judge:
</p>
<p>The appellant, “Company,” appeals from a contempt order of the
district court. Company refused to comply with a grand jury subpoena
insofar as it was directed to six documents that Company claimed were
covered by attorney-client privilege. The district court held the
privilege was waived as to all six documents. We agree that there was at
least a partial waiver of the privilege, but we remand for the district
court to further consider the scope of the waiver.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
I.
</p>
<p>Appellant is a government contractor performing work for the Defense
Department on a cost-plus basis. Company and its former chief executive
officer are under a grand jury investigation into the possibility of
Company’s tax evasion as well as a possible conspiracy to defraud the
United States. It is thought CEO may have engineered a scheme whereby he
received secret rebates (undeclared personal income to him) from
subcontractors while the amounts rebated were included on Company’s
books as payments to the subcontractors and thus business expenses.</p>
<p>The grand jury issued a subpoena in June 1988 to Company seeking
production of documents relating to certain adjusting entries made to
Company’s books in the latter part of 1987. Company produced the
documents sought, except for six it claimed were protected by the
attorney-client privilege. Three of these documents contain notes taken
by Company’s former vice president for finance at meetings with
attorneys from a law firm retained by Company. The other three are
memoranda from that vice president to Company’s chief accounting officer
transmitting the law firm’s legal advice to amend the corporate books to
reflect that certain amounts previously reported on its books—and to the
IRS—as business expenses be shown as nondeductible income payments to
CEO.</p>
<p>The government moved to compel production of all six documents,
arguing that the privilege was waived since the documents presumably
contained only information that had been or would eventually be reported
to the IRS. The district court granted the order, concluding “whatever
attorney-client privilege that may have attached to the documents was
waived by the filing (or the intention to file) of required forms to the
IRS.” Company refused to comply, was held in contempt, and thereafter
brought an appeal.</p>
<p>While the appeal was pending, the government learned that one of the
memoranda in question had already been disclosed, in January 1988, by
the CAO to the Defense Contract Audit Agency during a routine audit of
the contractor’s travel expenses. The government sought and gained a
remand to permit the district court to consider this additional ground
for the government’s claim of waiver. Appellant claimed on remand that
the disclosure of the one document to the DCAA had been inadvertent (“a
bureaucratic error”) and offered to prove that through the testimony of
its CAO, but only if his testimony were limited to that issue and his
Fifth Amendment privilege were not waived. The district court rejected
the proffer, reiterated its prior finding that if the privilege existed,
it had been waived because the information in the documents was to be
publicly reported, and further found that the disclosure of the one
document “was a voluntary intentional disclosure” which “constituted a
further waiver of the attorney-client privilege not only with respect to
the particular document but also as to all related communications.” The
district court believed that had the disclosure to DCAA been inadvertent
rather than intentional, it would have constituted a waiver (if that
were the sole grounds for finding a waiver) only with respect to that
document and not the other five.</p>
<p>Prior to the remand hearing it was further revealed that the vice
president had entered into a personal immunity agreement with the
government in October 1987 and, at that time, given all six of the
documents to the government without Company’s authorization. From that,
we infer the government continues to seek the documents through subpoena
because it is uncertain as to the use that can be made of the copies
voluntarily turned over by the vice president. The government asserts
that the attorney handling the grand jury proceedings has not been given
access to the documents. Nevertheless, Company urged the district court,
in the exercise of its supervisory power over grand jury proceedings, to
conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the government had
engaged in misconduct, which Company apparently thought might justify
quashing the subpoena. The district court declined to do so and Company
appeals that determination as well.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
II.
</p>
<p>The government does not dispute that all six documents fall within
Company’s attorney-client privilege. It is not argued, for instance,
that the memoranda from the vice president to the CAO, communicating the
advice given by counsel and directing the adjusting entries be made in
accordance with that advice, are outside the privilege. Nor is it
claimed that the conversation between the corporate officers and the law
firm were not intended to be confidential so that the privilege never
attached. Instead, the government relies on two grounds for concluding
Company waived the privilege for all six documents.</p>
<p>The government first claims that because the documents provide
background “detail” supporting the adjusting bookkeeping entries that
have been reported to the IRS, Company has waived its privilege in the
documents. The government relies on several cases that have addressed
the status of the attorney-client privilege in cases involving
disclosure of financial information to the IRS or other third parties.
In <em>United States v. Cote</em>, the Eighth Circuit held that the act
of filing amended IRS returns waived any attorney-client privilege in an
attorney-supervised accountant’s workpapers, which contained information
later transcribed onto the returns. But the Court remanded to the
district court to determine whether any of the workpapers contained
“unpublished expressions” not part of the data revealed on the tax
returns. The Court also recognized that in tax cases, waiver typically
is not an issue, because “the privilege is said not to attach to
information which the taxpayer intends his attorney to report in the
contents of a tax return.”</p>
<p>In that vein, <em>United States v. (Under Seal)</em> held that the
privilege did not cover documents, including communications between two
attorneys relating to a proposed tax ruling for a client, and material
supplied by the client concerning commercial transactions upon which the
proposed tax ruling would be based. These documents, according to the
court, either did not reveal client communications or were not meant to
be confidential. The court thus applied its previous holding in <em>In
re Grand Jury Proceedings</em> that “if a client communicates
information to his attorney with the understanding that the information
will be revealed to others, that information, as well as the details
underlying the data which was to be published, will not enjoy the
privilege.” Apparently recognizing the aphorism that “God is in the
details,” the court explained in a footnote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The details underlying the published data are the communications
relating the data, the document, if any, to be published containing the
data, all preliminary drafts of the document, and any attorney’s notes
containing material necessary to the preparation of the documents.
Copies of other documents, the contents of which were necessary to the
preparation of the published document, will also lose the privilege. But
if any of the non-privileged documents contain client communications not
directly related to the published data, those communications, if
otherwise privileged, must be removed by the reviewing court before the
document may be produced.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although these cases seem to conflate two theories—waiver of an
existing privilege and absence of an intent to maintain confidentiality
in the first place—we think under either theory the IRS cases are
inapposite; the government much too facilely claims that the six
documents are merely “details” underlying past or future returns. To be
sure, virtually all the material in the documents reflects adjusting
entries in Company’s books, which have been or will be reported to the
IRS.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">(n.4 in opinion) If the information has not yet been
disclosed, it is hard to think of Company’s action as a waiver. Rather,
data that Company intends to report is never privileged in the first
place.<br>
<br>
</span></span> But the crucial significance of the documents—and the
apparent reason the government wishes to present them to the grand
jury—is that they suggest Company made the adjusting entries on the
advice of counsel (after the investigation commenced).</p>
<p>The raison d’etre of the hallowed attorney-client privilege is the
protection of a client’s communications to counsel so that persons,
including organizations, will be induced to consult counsel when needed.
The attorney’s communications (his advice) to the client must also be
protected, because otherwise it is rather easy to deduce the client’s
communications to counsel. The documents sought in this case reveal
directly the attorney’s confidential advice, and their disclosure
thereby invades the core of the privilege; it permits an inference to be
drawn as to the nature of the client’s communications with its lawyers,
and, perhaps, as to their motivation (e.g., guilty knowledge) for
consulting counsel as well.</p>
<p>Even the very existence of an attorney-client relationship, not
normally protected, is privileged in the rare case when a “strong
possibility exists that disclosure of the information would implicate
the client in the very matter for which legal advice was sought in the
first case.” We therefore do not think that any portion of the six
documents revealing that the adjusting entries were made on the advice
of counsel would be disclosable under the government’s primary theory of
waiver.</p>
<p>Alternatively, however, the government relies on a waiver caused by
the disclosure of one memo to a DCAA auditor, and we think the
government is, in this respect, on firmer ground. It will be recalled
that Company does not dispute the disclosure but denies its
voluntariness, claiming it was inadvertent—“a bureaucratic error.” The
district court found otherwise, but we do not think it matters whether
the waiver is labeled “voluntary” or “inadvertent” and thus do not find
it necessary to consider appellant’s claim that the CAO should have been
permitted to offer limited testimony on this issue only.</p>
<p>Although the attorney-client privilege is of ancient lineage and
continuing importance, the confidentiality of communications covered by
the privilege must be jealously guarded by the holder of the privilege
lest it be waived. The courts will grant no greater protection to those
who assert the privilege than their own precautions warrant. We
therefore agree with those courts which have held that the privilege is
lost “even if the disclosure is inadvertent.”</p>
<p>Even assuming Company’s disclosure was due to “bureaucratic error,”
which we take to be a euphemism that necessarily implies human error,
that unfortunate lapse simply reveals that someone in the company and
thereby Company itself (since it can only act through its employees) was
careless with the confidentiality of its privileged communications.
Normally the amount of care taken to ensure confidentiality reflects the
importance of that confidentiality to the holder of the privilege. To
hold, as we do, that an inadvertent disclosure will waive the privilege
imposes a self-governing restraint on the freedom with which
organizations such as corporations, unions, and the like label documents
related to communications with counsel as privileged. To readily do so
creates a greater risk of “inadvertent” disclosure by someone and
thereby the danger that the “waiver” will extend to all related matters,
perhaps causing grave injury to the organization. But that is as it
should be. Otherwise, there is a temptation to seek artificially to
expand the content of privileged matter. In other words, if a client
wishes to preserve the privilege, it must treat the confidentiality of
attorney-client communications like jewels—if not crown jewels. Short of
court-compelled disclosure or other equally extraordinary
circumstances,<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">(n.5 in opinion) We do not face here any claim that the
information was acquired by a third party despite all possible
precautions, in which case there might be no waiver at all.<br>
<br>
</span></span> we will not distinguish between various degrees of
“voluntariness” in waivers of the attorney-client privilege.</p>
<p>Our conclusion that Company’s disclosure of the one memorandum
constitutes a waiver still leaves a question as to the scope of the
waiver. Appellant would confine the waiver to the one document, but, as
we have previously said, a waiver of the privilege in an attorney-client
communication extends “to all other communications relating to the same
subject matter.” Since such determinations properly depend heavily on
the factual context in which the privilege is asserted, we will not
disturb a district court’s decision as to the question unless it can be
shown the court abused its discretion. In this case, although the
district court extended the waiver to all six documents, it did not
fully explain why the communications were related. Of course, all
six—including the notes of the meeting—stemmed from the same
consultation Company had with its law firm. But the “subject matter” of
the waiver could, nevertheless, be defined in a number of different
ways. Did the district court mean, for instance, to define the “subject
matter” as all communications “relating” to the adjustment entries,
which—as suggested at oral argument—would permit the individual lawyers
and corporate officers present at the meeting to be called before the
grand jury to describe their discussions, or perhaps even other
communications between Company and its counsel? Or, alternatively, was
the waiver limited to those intra-Company communications revealing that
Company’s accounting adjustments were made upon the advice of counsel,
in which case is it not clear whether the actual notes of the meeting
must be disclosed? Given the potential implications of a broad
definition of the subject matter of Company’s waiver, we think it
appropriate to remand to the district court for further consideration of
that issue.</p>

<p class="case-h1">
MR. JUSTICE CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.
</p>
<p>There is a privilege protecting communications between attorney and
client. The privilege takes flight if the relation is abused. A client
who consults an attorney for advice that will serve him in the
commission of a fraud will have no help from the law. He must let the
truth be told. There are early cases apparently to the effect that a
mere charge of illegality, not supported by any evidence, will set the
confidences free. But this conception of the privilege is without
support in later rulings. “It is obvious that it would be absurd to say
that the privilege could be got rid of merely by making a charge of
fraud.” To drive the privilege away, there must be “something to give
colour to the charge;” there must be “prima facie evidence that it has
some foundation in fact.” When that evidence is supplied, the seal of
secrecy is broken. Nor does the loss of the privilege depend upon the
showing of a conspiracy, upon proof that client and attorney are
involved in equal guilt. The attorney may be innocent, and still the
guilty client must let the truth come out.</p>

<h4>United States v. Zolin, 491 U.S. 554 (1989)</h4>
<p class="case-h1">
JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court.
</p>
<p>This case arises out of the efforts of the Criminal Investigation
Division of the Internal Revenue Service to investigate the tax returns
of L. Ron Hubbard, founder of the Church of Scientology for the calendar
years 1979 through 1983. We granted certiorari to consider two issues
that have divided the Courts of Appeals. The first is whether, when a
district court enforces an IRS summons, the court may condition its
enforcement order by placing restrictions on the disclosure of the
summoned information. The Court of Appeals in this case upheld the
restrictions. We affirm its judgment on that issue by an equally divided
Court.</p>
<p>The second issue concerns the testimonial privilege for
attorney-client communications and, more particularly, the generally
recognized exception to that privilege for communications in furtherance
of future illegal conduct—the so-called “crime-fraud” exception. The
specific question presented is whether the applicability of the
crime-fraud exception must be established by “independent evidence”
(<em>i.e.</em>, without reference to the content of the contested
communications themselves), or, alternatively, whether the applicability
of that exception can be resolved by an <em>in camera</em> inspection of
the allegedly privileged material. We reject the “independent evidence”
approach and hold that the district court, under circumstances we
explore below, and at the behest of the party opposing the claim of
privilege, may conduct an <em>in camera</em> review of the materials in
question. Because the Court of Appeals considered only “independent
evidence,” we vacate its judgment on this issue and remand the case for
further proceedings.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
I
</p>
<p>In the course of its investigation, the IRS sought access to 51
documents that had been filed with the Clerk of the Los Angeles County
Superior Court in connection with a case entitled <em>Church of
Scientology of California v. Armstrong</em>. The <em>Armstrong</em>
litigation involved, among other things, a charge by the Church that one
of its former members, Gerald Armstrong, had obtained by unlawful means
documentary materials relating to Church activities, including two
tapes. Some of the documents sought by the IRS had been filed under
seal.</p>
<p>The IRS, by its Special Agent Steven Petersell, served a summons upon
the Clerk on October 24, 1984, demanding that he produce the 51
documents. The tapes were among those listed. On November 21, IRS agents
were permitted to inspect and copy some of the summoned materials,
including the tapes.</p>
<p>On November 27, the Church and Mary Sue Hubbard, who had intervened
in <em>Armstrong</em>, secured a temporary restraining order from the
United States District Court for the Central District of California. The
order required the IRS to file with the District Court all materials
acquired on November 21 and all reproductions and notes related thereto,
pending disposition of the intervenors’ motion for a preliminary
injunction to bar IRS use of these materials. By order dated December
10, the District Court returned to the IRS all materials except the
tapes and the IRS’ notes reflecting their contents.</p>
<p>On January 18, 1985, the IRS filed in the District Court a petition
to enforce its summons. In addition to the tapes, the IRS sought 12
sealed documents the Clerk had refused to produce in response to the IRS
summons. The Church and Mary Sue Hubbard intervened to oppose production
of the tapes and the sealed documents. Respondents claimed that IRS was
not seeking the documents in good faith, and objected on grounds of lack
of relevance and attorney-client privilege.</p>
<p>Respondents asserted the privilege as a bar to disclosure of the
tapes. The IRS argued, among other things, however, that the tapes fell
within the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege, and
urged the District Court to listen to the tapes in the course of making
its privilege determination. In addition, the IRS submitted to the court
two declarations by Agent Petersell. In the first, Petersell stated his
grounds for believing that the tapes were relevant to the investigation.
In the second, Petersell offered a description of the tapes’ contents,
based on information he received during several interviews. Appended to
this declaration—over respondents’ objection—were partial transcripts of
the tapes, which the IRS lawfully had obtained from a confidential
source.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">(n.5 in opionion) The IRS denied that the transcripts
were made using tapes obtained from the Superior Court or from any other
illicit source. Agent Petersell declared: “The partial transcripts were
not prepared by the United States from the tapes in the custody of the
Superior Court for Los Angeles County, California, nor from copies of
the tape now in the custody of the Clerk of this Court. The transcripts
were obtained from a confidential source by another Special Agent prior
to the issuance of this summons. The source was not a party to
<em>Church of Scientology v. Armstrong</em>, nor an attorney for any
party in that proceeding.” As the District Court made no finding of
illegality, we assume for present purposes that the transcripts were
legally obtained.<br>
<br>
</span></span> In subsequent briefing, the IRS reiterated its request
that the District Court listen to the tapes in camera before making its
privilege ruling.</p>
<p>After oral argument and an evidentiary hearing, the District Court
rejected respondents’ claim of bad faith. The court ordered production
of 5 of the 12 documents and specified: “The documents delivered
hereunder shall not be delivered to any other government agency by the
IRS unless criminal tax prosecution is sought or an Order of Court is
obtained.”</p>
<p>Turning to the tapes, the District Court ruled that respondents had
demonstrated that they contain confidential attorney-client
communications, that the privilege had not been waived, and that “the
‘fraud-crime’ exception to the attorney-client privilege does not apply.
The quoted excerpts tend to show or admit past fraud but there is no
clear indication that future fraud or crime is being planned.” On this
basis, the court held that the Clerk “need not produce its copy of the
tapes pursuant to the summons.” The District Court denied the IRS’
motion for reconsideration, rejecting the IRS’ renewed request that the
court listen to the tapes in toto. “While this was at one time discussed
with counsel, thereafter Mr. Petersell’s declaration was submitted, and
no one suggested that this was an inadequate basis on which to determine
the attorney-client privilege question.”</p>
<p>Respondents appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,
and the IRS cross-appealed on two relevant grounds. First, the IRS
claimed that the District Court abused its discretion by placing
conditions on the IRS’ future use of the subpoenaed information. The
Court of Appeals disagreed, holding: “A district court may, when
appropriate, condition enforcement of a summons on the IRS’ agreeing to
abide by disclosure restrictions.”</p>
<p>Second, the IRS contended that the District Court erred in rejecting
the application of the crime-fraud exception to the tapes. In
particular, the IRS argued that the District Court incorrectly held that
the IRS had abandoned its request for in camera review of the tapes, and
that the court should have listened to the tapes before ruling that the
crime-fraud exception was inapplicable. Respondents contended, in
contrast, that the District Court erred in the opposite direction: they
argued that it was error for the court to rely on the partial
transcripts, because “in this Circuit, a party cannot rely on the
communications themselves—whether by listening to the tapes or reviewing
excerpts or transcripts of them—to bear its burden to invoke the
exception but must bear the burden by independent evidence.”</p>
<p>The panel of the Court of Appeals agreed with respondents that, under
<em>Shewfelt</em>, “the Government’s evidence of crime or fraud must
come from sources independent of the attorney-client communications
recorded on the tapes,” thereby implicitly holding that even if the IRS
had properly preserved its demand for in camera review, the District
Court would have been without power to grant it. The Court of Appeals
then reviewed “the Government’s independent evidence.” That review
appears to have excluded the partial transcripts, and thus the Court of
Appeals implicitly agreed with respondents that it was improper for the
District Court to have considered even the partial transcripts. On the
basis of its review of the “independent evidence,” the Court of Appeals
affirmed the District Court’s determination that the IRS had failed to
establish the applicability of the crime-fraud exception.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
II
</p>
<p>This Court is evenly divided with respect to the issue of the power
of a district court to place restrictions upon the dissemination by the
IRS of information obtained through a § 7604 subpoena-enforcement
action. We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals insofar
as it upheld the District Court’s conditional-enforcement order.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
III
</p>
<p>Questions of privilege that arise in the course of the adjudication
of federal rights are “governed by the principles of the common law as
they may be interpreted by the courts of the United States in the light
of reason and experience.” We have recognized the attorney-client
privilege under federal law, as “the oldest of the privileges for
confidential communications known to the common law.” Although the
underlying rationale for the privilege has changed over time, courts
long have viewed its central concern as one “to encourage full and frank
communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote
broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of
justice.” That purpose, of course, requires that clients be free to
“make full disclosure to their attorneys” of past wrongdoings, in order
that the client may obtain “the aid of persons having knowledge of the
law and skilled in its practice.”</p>
<p>The attorney-client privilege is not without its costs. “Since the
privilege has the effect of withholding relevant information from the
factfinder, it applies only where necessary to achieve its purpose.” The
attorney-client privilege must necessarily protect the confidences of
wrongdoers, but the reason for that protection—the centrality of open
client and attorney communication to the proper functioning of our
adversary system of justice—“ceases to operate at a certain point,
namely, where the desired advice refers not to prior wrongdoing, but to
future wrongdoing.” It is the purpose of the crime-fraud exception to
the attorney-client privilege to assure that the “seal of secrecy,”
between lawyer and client does not extend to communications “made for
the purpose of getting advice for the commission of a fraud” or
crime.</p>
<p>The District Court and the Court of Appeals found that the tapes at
issue in this case recorded attorney-client communications and that the
privilege had not been waived when the tapes were inadvertently given to
Armstrong. These findings are not at issue here. Thus, the remaining
obstacle to respondents’ successful assertion of the privilege is the
Government’s contention that the recorded attorney-client communications
were made in furtherance of a future crime or fraud.</p>
<p>A variety of questions may arise when a party raises the crime-fraud
exception. The parties to this case have not been in complete agreement
as to which of these questions are presented here. In an effort to
clarify the matter, we observe, first, that we need not decide the
quantum of proof necessary ultimately to establish the applicability of
the crime-fraud exception. Rather, we are concerned here with the type
of evidence that may be used to make that ultimate showing. Within that
general area of inquiry, the initial question in this case is whether a
district court, at the request of the party opposing the privilege, may
review the allegedly privileged communications <em>in camera</em> to
determine whether the crime-fraud exception applies. If such <em>in
camera</em> review is permitted, the second question we must consider is
whether some threshold evidentiary showing is needed before the district
court may undertake the requested review. Finally, if a threshold
showing is required, we must consider the type of evidence the opposing
party may use to meet it: <em>i.e.</em>, in this case, whether the
partial transcripts the IRS possessed may be used for that purpose.</p>
<p class="case-h2">
A
</p>
<p>We consider first the question whether a district court may ever
honor the request of the party opposing the privilege to conduct an in
camera review of allegedly privileged communications to determine
whether those communications fall within the crime-fraud exception. We
conclude that no express provision of the Federal Rules of Evidence bars
such use of in camera review, and that it would be unwise to prohibit it
in all instances as a matter of federal common law.</p>
<p><em>(1)</em></p>
<p>At first blush, two provisions of the Federal Rules of Evidence would
appear to be relevant. Rule 104(a) provides: “Preliminary questions
concerning the qualification of a person to be a witness, the existence
of a privilege, or the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by
the court. In making its determination it is not bound by the rules of
evidence except those with respect to privileges.” Rule 1101(c)
provides: “The rule with respect to privileges applies at all stages of
all actions, cases, and proceedings.” Taken together, these Rules might
be read to establish that in a summons-enforcement proceeding,
attorney-client communications cannot be considered by the district
court in making its crime-fraud ruling: to do otherwise, under this
view, would be to make the crime-fraud determination without due regard
to the existence of the privilege.</p>
<p>Even those scholars who support this reading of Rule 104(a)
acknowledge that it leads to an absurd result.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because the judge must honor claims of privilege made during his
preliminary fact determinations, many exceptions to the rules of
privilege will become “dead letters,” since the preliminary facts that
give rise to these exceptions can never be proved. For example, an
exception to the attorney-client privilege provides that there is no
privilege if the communication was made to enable anyone to commit a
crime or fraud. There is virtually no way in which the exception can
ever be proved, save by compelling disclosure of the contents of the
communication; Rule 104(a) provides that this cannot be done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We find this Draconian interpretation of Rule 104(a) inconsistent
with the Rule’s plain language. The Rule does not provide by its terms
that all materials as to which a “claim of privilege” is made must be
excluded from consideration. In that critical respect, the language of
Rule 104(a) is markedly different from the comparable California
evidence rule, which provides that “the presiding officer may not
require disclosure of information claimed to be privileged under this
division in order to rule on the claim of privilege.” There is no reason
to read Rule 104(a) as if its text were identical to that of the
California rule.</p>
<p>Nor does it make sense to us to assume, as respondents have
throughout this litigation, that once the attorney-client nature of the
contested communications is established, those communications must be
treated as presumptively privileged for evidentiary purposes until the
privilege is “defeated” or “stripped away” by proof that the
communications took place in the course of planning future crime or
fraud. Although some language in <em>Clark</em> might be read as
supporting this view, respondents acknowledged at oral argument that no
prior holding of this Court requires the imposition of a strict
progression of proof in crime-fraud cases.</p>
<p>We see no basis for holding that the tapes in this case must be
deemed privileged under Rule 104(a) while the question of crime or fraud
remains open. Indeed, respondents concede that “if the proponent of the
privilege is able to sustain its burden only by submitting the
communications to the court” for <em>in camera</em> review, the court is
not required to avert its eyes (or close its ears) once it concludes
that the communication would be privileged, if the court found the
crime-fraud exception inapplicable. Rather, respondents acknowledge that
the court may “then consider the same communications to determine if the
opponent of the privilege has established that the crime-fraud exception
applies.” Were the tapes truly deemed privileged under Rule 104(a) at
the moment the trial court concludes they contain potentially privileged
attorney-client communications, district courts would be required to
draw precisely the counterintuitive distinction that respondents wisely
reject. We thus shall not adopt a reading of Rule 104(a) that would
treat the contested communications as “privileged” for purposes of the
Rule, and we shall not interpret Rule 104(a) as categorically
prohibiting the party opposing the privilege on crime-fraud grounds from
relying on the results of an in camera review of the communications.</p>
<p><em>(2)</em></p>
<p>Having determined that Rule 104(a) does not prohibit the <em>in
camera</em> review sought by the IRS, we must address the question as a
matter of the federal common law of privileges. We conclude that a
complete prohibition against opponents’ use of <em>in camera</em> review
to establish the applicability of the crime-fraud exception is
inconsistent with the policies underlying the privilege.</p>
<p>We begin our analysis by recognizing that disclosure of allegedly
privileged materials to the district court for purposes of determining
the merits of a claim of privilege does not have the legal effect of
terminating the privilege. Indeed, this Court has approved the practice
of requiring parties who seek to avoid disclosure of documents to make
the documents available for in camera inspection, and the practice is
well established in the federal courts. Respondents do not dispute this
point: they acknowledge that they would have been free to request <em>in
camera</em> review to establish the fact that the tapes involved
attorney-client communications, had they been unable to muster
independent evidence to serve that purpose.</p>
<p>Once it is clear that <em>in camera</em> review does not destroy the
privileged nature of the contested communications, the question of the
propriety of that review turns on whether the policies underlying the
privilege and its exceptions are better fostered by permitting such
review or by prohibiting it. In our view, the costs of imposing an
absolute bar to consideration of the communications <em>in camera</em>
for purpose of establishing the crime-fraud exception are intolerably
high.</p>
<p>“No matter how light the burden of proof which confronts the party
claiming the exception, there are many blatant abuses of privilege which
cannot be substantiated by extrinsic evidence. This is particularly true
of situations in which an alleged illegal proposal is made in the
context of a relationship which has an apparent legitimate end.” A per
se rule that the communications in question may never be considered
creates, we feel, too great an impediment to the proper functioning of
the adversary process. This view is consistent with current trends in
the law.</p>
<p class="case-h2">
B
</p>
<p>We turn to the question whether in camera review at the behest of the
party asserting the crime-fraud exception is always permissible, or, in
contrast, whether the party seeking in camera review must make some
threshold showing that such review is appropriate. In addressing this
question, we attend to the detrimental effect, if any, of in camera
review on the policies underlying the privilege and on the orderly
administration of justice in our courts. We conclude that some such
showing must be made.</p>
<p>Our endorsement of the practice of testing proponents’ privilege
claims through <em>in camera</em> review of the allegedly privileged
documents has not been without reservation. This Court noted that
“examination of the evidence, even by the judge alone, in chambers”
might in some cases “jeopardize the security which the privilege is
meant to protect.” Analogizing to claims of Fifth Amendment privilege,
it observed more generally: “Too much judicial inquiry into the claim of
privilege would force disclosure of the thing the privilege was meant to
protect, while a complete abandonment of judicial control would lead to
intolerable abuses.”</p>
<p>The Court recognized that some compromise must be reached. In
<em>Reynolds</em>, it declined to “go so far as to say that the court
may automatically require a complete disclosure to the judge before the
claim of privilege will be accepted in any case.” We think that much the
same result is in order here.</p>
<p>A blanket rule allowing <em>in camera</em> review as a tool for
determining the applicability of the crime-fraud exception, as
<em>Reynolds</em> suggests, would place the policy of protecting open
and legitimate disclosure between attorneys and clients at undue risk.
There is also reason to be concerned about the possible due process
implications of routine use of <em>in camera</em> proceedings. Finally,
we cannot ignore the burdens in camera review places upon the district
courts, which may well be required to evaluate large evidentiary records
without open adversarial guidance by the parties.</p>
<p>There is no reason to permit opponents of the privilege to engage in
groundless fishing expeditions, with the district courts as their
unwitting (and perhaps unwilling) agents. Courts of Appeals have
suggested that <em>in camera</em> review is available to evaluate claims
of crime or fraud only “when justified” or “in appropriate cases.”
Indeed, the Government conceded at oral argument (albeit reluctantly)
that a district court would be mistaken if it reviewed documents in
camera solely because “the government begged it” to do so, “with no
reason to suspect crime or fraud.” We agree.</p>
<p>In fashioning a standard for determining when <em>in camera</em>
review is appropriate, we begin with the observation that “<em>in
camera</em> inspection is a smaller intrusion upon the confidentiality
of the attorney-client relationship than is public disclosure.” We
therefore conclude that a lesser evidentiary showing is needed to
trigger in camera review than is required ultimately to overcome the
privilege. Ibid. The threshold we set, in other words, need not be a
stringent one.</p>
<p>We think that the following standard strikes the correct balance.
Before engaging in in camera review to determine the applicability of
the crime-fraud exception, “the judge should require a showing of a
factual basis adequate to support a good faith belief by a reasonable
person” that in camera review of the materials may reveal evidence to
establish the claim that the crime-fraud exception applies.</p>
<p>Once that showing is made, the decision whether to engage in <em>in
camera</em> review rests in the sound discretion of the district court.
The court should make that decision in light of the facts and
circumstances of the particular case, including, among other things, the
volume of materials the district court has been asked to review, the
relative importance to the case of the alleged privileged information,
and the likelihood that the evidence produced through <em>in camera</em>
review, together with other available evidence then before the court,
will establish that the crime-fraud exception does apply. The district
court is also free to defer its <em>in camera</em> review if it
concludes that additional evidence in support of the crime-fraud
exception may be available that is not allegedly privileged, and that
production of the additional evidence will not unduly disrupt or delay
the proceedings.</p>
<p class="case-h2">
C
</p>
<p>The question remains as to what kind of evidence a district court may
consider in determining whether it has the discretion to undertake an
<em>in camera</em> review of an allegedly privileged communication at
the behest of the party opposing the privilege. Here, the issue is
whether the partial transcripts may be used by the IRS in support of its
request for <em>in camera</em> review of the tapes.</p>
<p>The answer to that question, in the first instance, must be found in
Rule 104(a), which establishes that materials that have been determined
to be privileged may not be considered in making the preliminary
determination of the existence of a privilege. Neither the District
Court nor the Court of Appeals made factual findings as to the
privileged nature of the partial transcripts, so we cannot determine on
this record whether Rule 104(a) would bar their consideration.</p>
<p>Assuming for the moment, however, that no rule of privilege bars the
IRS’s use of the partial transcripts, we fail to see what purpose would
be served by excluding the transcripts from the District Court’s
consideration. There can be little doubt that partial transcripts, or
other evidence directly but incompletely reflecting the content of the
contested communications, generally will be strong evidence of the
subject matter of the communications themselves. Permitting district
courts to consider this type of evidence would aid them substantially in
rapidly and reliably determining whether <em>in camera</em> review is
appropriate.</p>
<p>Respondents suggest only one serious countervailing consideration. In
their view, a rule that would allow an opponent of the privilege to rely
on such material would encourage litigants to elicit confidential
information from disaffected employees or others who have access to the
information. We think that deterring the aggressive pursuit of relevant
information from third-party sources is not sufficiently central to the
policies of the attorney-client privilege to require us to adopt the
exclusionary rule urged by respondents. We conclude that the party
opposing the privilege may use any nonprivileged evidence in support of
its request for in camera review, even if its evidence is not
“independent” of the contested communications as the Court of Appeals
uses that term.<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">(n.12 in opinion) In addition, we conclude that
evidence that is not “independent” of the contents of allegedly
privileged communications—like the partial transcripts in this case—may
be used not only in the pursuit of in camera review, but also may
provide the evidentiary basis for the ultimate showing that the
crime-fraud exception applies. We see little to distinguish these two
uses: in both circumstances, if the evidence has not itself been
determined to be privileged, its exclusion does not serve the policies
which underlie the attorney-client privilege.<br>
<br>
</span></span></p>
<p class="case-h2">
D
</p>
<p>In sum, we conclude that a rigid independent evidence requirement
does not comport with “reason and experience,” and we decline to adopt
it as part of the developing federal common law of evidentiary
privileges. We hold that <em>in camera</em> review may be used to
determine whether allegedly privileged attorney-client communications
fall within the crime-fraud exception. We further hold, however, that
before a district court may engage in in camera review at the request of
the party opposing the privilege, that party must present evidence
sufficient to support a reasonable belief that in camera review may
yield evidence that establishes the exception’s applicability. Finally,
we hold that the threshold showing to obtain <em>in camera</em> review
may be met by using any relevant evidence, lawfully obtained, that has
not been adjudicated to be privileged.</p>
<p>Because the Court of Appeals employed a rigid independent-evidence
requirement which categorically excluded the partial transcripts and the
tapes themselves from consideration, we vacate its judgment on this
issue and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion. On remand, the Court of Appeals should consider whether the
District Court’s refusal to listen to the tapes in toto was justified by
the manner in which the IRS presented and preserved its request for
<em>in camera</em> review. In the event the Court of Appeals holds that
the IRS’s demand for review was properly preserved, the Court of Appeals
should then determine, or remand the case to the District Court to
determine in the first instance, whether the IRS has presented a
sufficient evidentiary basis for <em>in camera</em> review, and whether,
if so, it is appropriate for the District Court, in its discretion, to
grant such review.</p>

<h4>Blumenthal v. Kimber Mfg., 265 Conn. 1 (2003)</h4>
<p class="case-h1">
Katz, J.
</p>
<p>The petitioner, Richard Blumenthal, the attorney general of the state
of Connecticut, appeals from the decision of the trial court denying his
application for an order requiring the respondents, Kimber
Manufacturing, Inc., a firearms manufacturer with its principal place of
business in Yonkers, New York, and Leslie Edelman, Kimber’s president,
to comply with the petitioner’s discovery request for a certain document
sent from one Kimber employee to an attorney and three other Kimber
employees. The petitioner contends that the trial court improperly
determined that: (1) the communication was protected by the
attorney-client privilege; and (2) the communication was not otherwise
subject to disclosure under the crime-fraud exception to that privilege.
We conclude that the trial court properly determined that the document
was protected by the attorney-client privilege and that the petitioner
did not meet his burden of establishing that the crime-fraud exception
applies to exclude the document from protection under the privilege.
Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>
<p>The record discloses the following relevant facts. On March 17, 2000,
Smith and Wesson Corporation (Smith &amp; Wesson), a firearms
manufacturer located in Springfield, Massachusetts, entered into an
agreement with representatives of various federal, state and local
governmental agencies (agreement). The agreement was an attempt to
settle both pending and threatened litigation by these governmental
agencies against various firearms manufacturers. The agreement required
Smith &amp; Wesson, as well as all other potential signatories to the
agreement, to engage in certain practices, opposed by most of the
firearms industry, regarding the manufacturing, sale and marketing of
firearms. At the time of the proceeding before the trial court, Smith
&amp; Wesson was the only firearms manufacturer to have signed the
agreement.</p>
<p>On May 2, 2000, based on his suspicion of the respondents’
participation in a retaliatory economic boycott against Smith &amp;
Wesson, the petitioner issued to the respondents interrogatories and a
subpoena duces tecum, pursuant to the petitioner’s investigatory
authority under General Statutes § 35-42, seeking documents “as to any
matter relevant to any alleged violation of the Connecticut Antitrust
Act”; and specifically any documents related to Smith &amp; Wesson. On
May 31, 2000, the respondents submitted responses, and thereafter
submitted supplemental responses on July 20 and December 28, 2000.
Unsatisfied with the respondents’ disclosure, on March 20, 2001, the
petitioner filed with the trial court an application for compliance.
Thereafter, the respondents submitted five additional supplemental
responses, leading to a total disclosure of approximately 577 pages of
documents. After negotiation between the parties as to outstanding
documents sought, the hearing on the petitioner’s application for
compliance was reduced to one issue—a claim of attorney-client privilege
on a document sent via electronic mail (e-mail) by Dwight Van Brunt, a
Kimber employee, to Edelman, Denis Schusterman, another Kimber employee,
and Jerry S. Goldman, an attorney in private practice. The e-mail also
was copied to Ryan Busse, another Kimber employee. The e-mail expressly
referred to the Smith &amp; Wesson agreement, and the firearms
industry’s initial reaction to it.</p>
<p>In response to a joint motion for entry of consent order, the trial
court directed the respondents to submit the e-mail to the court for an
in camera determination of the privilege issue. The parties submitted to
the court a joint stipulation of facts, setting forth the factual and
procedural background of the matter. At a hearing on the consent order,
following a joint request, the trial court sealed the record.</p>
<p>Goldman, one of the parties to whom the e-mail had been sent,
appeared as counsel on behalf of the respondents. Goldman represented to
the court that, because the agreement arose out of a series of lawsuits
that all named John Doe as a defendant in the complaints, potential
firearms manufacturer defendants, like Kimber, needed to evaluate the
agreement and the firearms industry’s reaction to the agreement in order
to plan an effective legal strategy of their own. Goldman also provided
the court with the corporate titles of each of the e-mail recipients,
which identified them as senior Kimber officers. Goldman contended that,
because the reactions of others in the firearms industry to the
agreement—such as whether to sign similar agreements or litigate—would
inform Kimber’s legal decision making, Kimber’s management needed to
keep track of these developments and communicate them to him, as
Kimber’s counsel.</p>
<p>The petitioner contended that the e-mail was not subject to the
attorney-client privilege because it was not marked as confidential and
did not request legal advice; rather, according to the petitioner, the
subject matter of the e-mail concerned ongoing business developments.
The petitioner also contended that the respondents had presented no
evidence that litigation had been filed or even threatened against
Kimber, nor any evidence of the existence of “John Doe” defendants in
such litigation. The petitioner further claimed that, because reference
to the e-mail itself did not indicate that it satisfied the requirements
of the attorney-client privilege, and because the respondents did not
produce any evidence beyond the e-mail and the stipulated facts, the
respondents had failed to satisfy their burden of proof to invoke the
privilege. Furthermore, the petitioner argued that, even if the trial
court were to infer that the e-mail had been a request for legal advice,
and therefore privileged, it would be subject to disclosure under the
crime-fraud exception to the privilege.</p>
<p>On September 10, 2001, the same day as the consent order hearing, the
trial court issued an order stating that the e-mail was subject to a
valid claim of attorney-client privilege. On January 30, 2002, in
response to the petitioner’s motion for articulation, the trial court
issued a memorandum of decision setting forth the reasons for its
decision. Specifically, the trial court set forth and applied the four
part test that we articulated in <em>Shew v. Freedom of Information
Commission,</em> for determining whether the attorney-client privilege
applies to protect communications between corporate employees and
attorneys retained by the corporation. The court determined that, under
the test, the e-mail qualified for protection from disclosure.
Additionally, the court concluded that the crime-fraud exception did not
apply because the e-mail “is a patent update of firearms litigation
developments and does not advocate any criminal or illegal activity.”
This appeal followed.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
I
</p>
<p>We turn to the petitioner’s claim that, even if we were to assume
that the privilege generally applied, the trial court improperly
determined that the e-mail was not subject to disclosure under the
crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege. Specifically,
the petitioner contends that other documents submitted as exhibits to
the trial court provide probable cause to believe that the respondents
engaged in an unlawful boycott of Smith &amp; Wesson and that the e-mail
was in direct furtherance of the boycott. We conclude that the trial
court properly concluded that the e-mail did not fall under the
crime-fraud exception.</p>
<p>As an initial matter, we note that “exceptions to the attorney-client
privilege should be made only when the reason for disclosure outweighs
the potential chilling of essential communications.” The crime-fraud
exception to the attorney-client privilege, therefore, is a limited one,
and the burden of proof is on the party seeking to pierce the privilege.
We also recognize, however, “that since the attorney-client privilege
has the effect of withholding relevant information from the fact-finder,
it applies only where necessary to achieve its purpose.” In
<em>Olson</em> v. <em>Accessory Controls &amp; Equipment Corp.,</em> we
set forth the proper inquiry for determining when the crime-fraud
exception extinguishes the attorney-client privilege. The exception
applies only after a determination by the trial court “that there is
probable cause to believe that a crime or fraud has been attempted or
committed and that the communication was in furtherance thereof.”</p>
<p>Probable cause “requires that a prudent person have a reasonable
basis to suspect the perpetration or attempted perpetration of a crime
or fraud, and that the communication was in furtherance thereof.” “The
appropriate inquiry under the probable cause standard targets the
client’s intent in obtaining legal advice; only if there is probable
cause to believe that the client intended to perpetrate a crime or fraud
does the exception properly come to bear.” We have explained that,
“without reference to intent, the attorney-client privilege would be
pierced whenever probable cause could be made that an illegal act
occurred after the client conferred with an attorney—even if the
consultation was part of a good-faith attempt to follow the law.
Good-faith consultations with attorneys by clients who are uncertain
about the legal implications of a proposed course of action however are
entitled to the protection of the privilege, even if that action should
later be held improper.”</p>
<p>We note that, in the present case, the trial court did not determine
specifically whether the petitioner had met this probable cause
requirement. Even if we were to assume, however, that there was probable
cause to believe that the respondents had committed or intended to
commit a crime by engaging in an economic boycott in violation of
antitrust law, we nevertheless conclude that the petitioner failed to
meet his burden of proof.</p>
<p>In addition to probable cause, the crime-fraud exception is limited
by a second requirement that the communication sought in discovery was
made in furtherance of that unlawful act. “The crime-fraud exception
does not apply simply because privileged communications would provide an
adversary with evidence of a crime or fraud. Mere relevance is
insufficient; there must be a showing that the communications at issue
were made with an intent to further an unlawful act.”</p>
<p>Our analysis as to the “in furtherance” requirement is informed
largely by our reasoning in part I of this opinion. As we previously
stated, the trial court reasonably could have found that the e-mail
concerned matters involving the agreement by a major firearms
manufacturer seeking to avoid litigation, and how that agreement, along
with the litigation that gave rise to it, similarly might affect the
respondents. Moreover, the e-mail reveals nothing that suggests an
intent to break the law. Indeed, we agree with the trial court’s
determination that the critical statements at issue are “not words of
advocacy, but, rather, statements of fact or impression.” Furthermore,
to the extent that the e-mail refers to any action, it is the actions of
others, and not of the respondents; it neither advocates that Kimber
take any action of its own, nor that others take a particular action.
The evidence does not support a conclusion that the respondents sent the
e-mail with the intent to further a fraud or crime. Rather, as the trial
court reasonably concluded, it was intended to keep Goldman informed so
that he could provide them with sound legal advice. Accordingly, the
injury that would inure to the relationship of Kimber and its attorneys
by disclosure of the e-mail is greater than the benefit that would be
gained by its disclosure to the petitioner.</p>
<p>Therefore, we conclude that the trial court properly concluded that
the e-mail is not subject to disclosure under the crime-fraud exception
to the attorney-client privilege.</p>

<h4>Moody v. Internal Revenue Service, 654 F.2d 795 (D.C. Cir.
1981)</h4>
<p class="case-h1">
WALD, Circuit Judge
</p>
<p>This action is an appeal from a judgment of the district court
upholding the Internal Revenue Service’s refusal to disclose documents
pertinent to appellant’s Freedom of Information Act requests. Appellant
Shearn Moody, Jr. filed three requests pursuant to the FOIA, asking for
the release of all records in the IRS’s possession regarding Moody,
several business and charitable entities in which he had interests, and
“Project Southwest.” The IRS released many documents pertinent to these
requests, but withheld approximately 150 documents or portions of
documents. After an <em>in camera</em> examination of a sample of
thirty-five of the challenged withholdings, the district court upheld
the IRS’s claims of exemptions with respect to all except portions of
four documents.</p>
<p>The appellant promptly challenged every aspect of the trial court’s
decision, seeking before this court both reversal of the findings of
applicability of FOIA exemptions to particular documents and a remand on
the issues of segregability and the propriety of an award of attorney’s
fees. The bulk of appellant’s arguments on appeal were explicitly, and
we feel correctly, dealt with in the district court’s admirably
comprehensive nineteen page opinion. However, we find two issues deserve
additional consideration, and remand the case to the district court for
this purpose.</p>
<p class="case-h3">
DOCUMENT 19 AND THE WORK PRODUCT EXEMPTION
</p>
<p>Exemption 5 of the FOIA permits non-disclosure of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not
be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with
the agency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Among the civil litigation privileges incorporated into the FOIA by
this section is the attorney work product privilege.</p>
<p>The work product privilege, “distinct from and broader than the
attorney-client privilege,” exempts from discovery documents prepared by
an attorney in contemplation of litigation. Document 19, which the trial
court held non-disclosable as attorney work product, seems to fall
within this class. It details a meeting held between an IRS lawyer and
the federal district judge presiding over the receivership of W. L.
Moody &amp; Sons, Banker, regarding the enforcement of a summons served
on E. O. Buck, the bank’s receiver. Prepared as a memorandum to the file
by the participating IRS attorney, Document 19 predates by two days the
filing of a petition to enforce the summons.</p>
<p>Appellant contends, however, that the work product doctrine does not
cover Document 19 because it is the fruit of impermissible legal
conduct. According to appellant, the purposeful exclusion of opposing
counsel from the meeting violated the court’s rules and the American Bar
Association’s ethical standards. Moody argues that it would be a
perversion of the work product doctrine, designed “to encourage
effective legal representation within the framework of the adversary
system,” to allow it to be used to “cover up” activities destructive of
that system.</p>
<p>We agree that, at least in some circumstances, a lawyer’s
unprofessional behavior may vitiate the work product privilege. We
therefore remand this case to the district court so that it may
determine in the first instance whether such circumstances exist in this
case, and more fundamentally, whether the actions of the IRS attorney in
fact violated professional standards.</p>
<p>The work product privilege creates a zone of privacy within which a
lawyer can prepare his case free of adversarial scrutiny. From its
inception, however, the courts have stressed that the privilege is “not
to protect any interest of the attorney, who is no more entitled to
privacy or protection than any other person, but to protect the
adversary trial process itself.” Some protection of lawyers’ “heretofore
inviolate” thoughts was deemed necessary to avoid an incentive to
develop “unfair and sharp practices for the giving of legal advice and
in the preparation of cases for trial,” as the development of such
practices would “poorly serve the interests of the clients and the cause
of justice.”</p>
<p>It would indeed be perverse, as appellant contends, to allow a lawyer
to claim an evidentiary privilege to prevent disclosure of work product
generated by those very activities the privilege was meant to prevent.
Non-disclosure would then<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-6" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">(n.17 in opinion) We stress that in this case, appellee
has admitted engaging in the conduct which forms the basis of the charge
of unprofessional conduct. We are therefore not dealing with a situation
where disclosure is sought for the purpose of determining whether such
misbehavior has in fact occurred. The latter case involves an entirely
different problem—an exception which threatens to swallow the rule—than
is presented in this case.<br>
<br>
</span></span> provide an incentive for, rather than against, the
disfavored practices. The integrity of the adversary process is not
furthered by protecting a lawyer who steps outside his role as “an
officer of the court working for the advancement of justice while
faithfully protecting the rightful interests of his clients.” An
attorney should not be able to exploit the privilege for ends outside of
and antithetical to the adversary system any more than a client who
attempts to use the privilege to advance criminal or fraudulent
ends.</p>
<p>However, the conclusion that an attorney has no right to object to
the disclosure of work product made possible by his misconduct does not
necessarily mean that the work product privilege is inapplicable to such
documents. Unlike the attorney-client privilege, which exists solely for
the benefit of the client, and can be asserted and waived exclusively by
him, the work product privilege creates a legally protectable interest
in non-disclosure in two parties: lawyer and client. Just as “an
invasion of the attorney’s necessary privacy may not be justified by the
misfortune of representing a fraudulent client,” the client’s interest
in preventing disclosures about his case may survive the misfortune of
his representation by an unscrupulous attorney. A court must look to all
the circumstances of the case, including the availability of alternate
disciplinary procedures<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-7" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">(n.23 in opinion) Lawyers, of course, are always
subject to disciplinary proceedings, if not criminal or civil
malpractice sanctions, for malfeasance in the conduct of their legal
affairs. Thus, disclosure is not the sole available remedy for a breach
of a professional duty, and may in fact bear so little relationship to
the underlying breach as to be inappropriate as a remedy. In this case,
of course, if a violation of legal standards occurred, it lay in the
attorney’s exclusion of the opposing party and his counsel from a
meeting; disclosure of what went on at that meeting to that opponent,
the appellant in this FOIA action, would therefore seem an appropriate
remedy.<br>
<br>
</span></span>, to decide whether the policy favoring disclosure
outweighs the client’s legitimate interest<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-8" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">(n.24 in opinion) A client’s interest in non-disclosure
would be illegitimate, of course, if he knowingly instigated or
participated in the conduct which constituted the breach of duty. In
some cases, the extent to which a client should be allowed to benefit
from unprofessionally obtained information may also be questioned; such
benefits, in some cases, may not be deemed a “legitimate” secrecy
interest.<br>
<br>
</span></span> in secrecy. No court should order disclosure under the
FOIA or in discovery if the disclosure would traumatize the adversary
process more than the underlying legal misbehavior.</p>
<p>We have attempted to outline in our footnotes to this opinion some of
the factors we would take into consideration when balancing the policy
favoring disclosure against that favoring continued secrecy. However,
each case obviously presents new permutations and combinations of fact
patterns, all of which must be taken into account when reaching a
decision. For this reason, the trial court, which is both familiar with
the case and in a position to gather any evidence deemed necessary to a
reasoned decision, is best equipped to weigh the balance.</p>
<p>We therefore remand this case for reconsideration of the withholdings
from Document 19 in light of our <em>Neufeld</em> decision, for an
evaluation of the attorney’s conduct and, if it is found in violation of
professional standards, a determination of whether his breach of
professional standards vitiated the work product privilege otherwise
attributable to Document 19. If the documents released as a result of
the proceedings on remand are sufficient for a court to conclude
appellant substantially prevailed in his FOIA action, he will then
become eligible for an award of attorney’s fees.</p>

<h4>Haigh v. Matsushita Elec. Corp. of America, 676 F. Supp. 1332 (E.D.
Va. 1987)</h4>
<p class="case-h1">
SPENCER, District Judge.
</p>
<p>Plaintiff Richard Haigh, a Virginia citizen, was employed by
defendant Matsushita Electric Corporation of America from October 17,
1974 through January 27, 1987. He is fifty-seven years old, and is
Jewish. Plaintiff Norma Haigh, a Virginia citizen, is Haigh’s wife.</p>
<p>Defendant Panasonic is a Delaware corporation.</p>
<p>The Second Amended Complaint, which is currently before the Court, is
sixty-eight pages long, and contains a plethora of allegations. In
brief, Haigh states that he was a salesman for Panasonic who handled the
accounts of Best Products and Circuit City. Haigh claims that during his
tenure business with these two outfits skyrocketed. In December 1986,
Haigh was told that the Best Products and Circuit City accounts were
being taken away from him and given to defendant Weber. Haigh also
claims he was told his salary would be cut, along with his earnable
bonuses. Additionally, he was told that he would be reassigned from his
Richmond, Virginia location to the Panasonic accounts in western
Virginia. Haigh claims he argued that the reassignment was unlawful, and
requested to be told the legitimate business reason for the action. In
response, defendants Willner and Adamyk allegedly proposed that the
Richmond accounts of Thalhimers, Miller &amp; Rhoads, Robert’s Leasing,
and Dominion Pottery be added to Haigh’s new territory. Haigh also
asserts that these two defendants sought a complete release for all of
Panasonic’s actions to date.</p>
<p>In due course, by letter dated January 27, 1987, Haigh stated that
his reassignment was unacceptable, and claimed that Panasonic had
constructively terminated his employment. Since that time, Haigh claims
to have vigorously sought employment without success.</p>
<p>Defendants move for an order compelling discovery of certain tape
recordings, and awarding expenses in connection thereto. The facts
underlying the motion are as follows. Defendants made the usual request
for production of documents in August 1987. Subsequently, during Haigh’s
deposition on October 21, 1987, he admitted that he had taped
conversations with fifty-eight individuals. The tapes were made without
the knowledge of these individuals, at Haigh’s own initiative, and
absent directives from Haigh’s attorneys. Upon learning of their
existence, defendants asked for the tapes. Plaintiffs turned over three
tapes, which contained conversations with named defendants. Plaintiffs
also surrendered a list of the names of the individuals who were on the
recordings.</p>
<p>Defendants now seek the production of all the recordings. Plaintiffs
argue that the tapes come within the work product privilege in that they
were prepared in anticipation of litigation. Specifically, plaintiffs
state that Haigh consulted legal counsel in December 1986, evidently
fearing that defendants were trying to push him out of the company.
Haigh considered himself constructively terminated in late January 1987.
On March 12, 1987, he filed an EEOC complaint. He states that between
February 1987 and October 1987, he made the tape recordings. He
delivered the cassette tapes to counsel for the plaintiffs within a day
or two following each conversation, and the contents of such tapes were
reviewed by counsel and used by counsel to prepare the Complaint and
discovery requests.</p>
<p>This matter came before the Court on defendants’ November 2, 1987
motion. The motion was briefed by the parties, and oral argument was
held on November 13, 1987, at which time the Court directed counsel to
submit additional memoranda addressed to the question whether the work
product privilege had been vitiated. The parties have filed their
memoranda, and the motion is now ripe for decision. Although several
issues are raised by the parties, only two need to be addressed by this
Court.</p>
<p>Issue I—Are the tapes protected by the work product privilege?</p>
<p>Issue II—If the answer to the question in Issue I is yes, is the
privilege vitiated in this case?</p>
<p class="case-h1">
Issue I
</p>
<p>Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(3) addresses the work product
privilege. Basically, in order for the privilege to be applicable, the
material must be (1) documents or tangible things, (2) prepared in
anticipation of litigation or for trial, and (3) prepared by or for
another party or by or for that other party’s representative.
Additionally, the question whether the material was prepared in
anticipation of litigation does not turn on whether a suit had already
been filed.</p>
<p>In arguing that the work product privilege does not apply here,
defendants make the following statement: “The tapes were made by a party
to this action and apparently do not contain the thoughts and
impressions of plaintiff’s counsel, who was not involved in the
conversations, and, therefore, cannot be considered attorneys’ work
product under the most liberal interpretation of that doctrine.”</p>
<p>Defendants are living in the past, and are presenting a pre-1970
argument. “The 1970 amendment to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 extends the work
product protection to documents and things prepared for litigation or
trial by or for the adverse party himself or his agent. Prior to the
amendment some cases have held that documents of this kind were not
within the immunity.”</p>
<p>Moreover, in an identical situation, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York held that a party’s
surreptitiously obtained tape recordings are protected under Fed. R.
Civ. P. 26(b)(3), assuming that the statements were obtained and
recorded in anticipation of litigation or in preparation for trial.</p>
<p>Based upon the facts and arguments as now appearing before the Court,
the Court is of the opinion that the work product privilege would apply
to the tape recordings, and production would be denied unless the Court
became convinced that defendants had a substantial need for the
recordings and were unable to obtain their equivalent without undue
hardship.</p>
<p class="case-h1">
Issue II
</p>
<p>The Court need not delve into questions of “substantial need,” “undue
hardship,” or “substantial equivalent.” The Court holds that the work
product privilege has, in this case, been vitiated.</p>
<p>In recent years, courts have come to recognize that “in some
circumstances, a lawyer’s unprofessional behavior may vitiate the work
product privilege.”</p>
<p>The <em>Moody</em> opinion was discussed by the Eleventh Circuit in
<em>Parrott v. Wilson</em>. There, plaintiff’s attorney had
clandestinely taped telephone conversations with two witnesses.
Defendants moved to compel production of the recordings, and plaintiff
objected on the ground that the tapes were work product under Fed. R.
Civ. P. 26(b)(3). It is helpful to quote in length from that
opinion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <em>Moody</em> court reasoned that the purpose of the work
product privilege is to protect the integrity of the adversary process;
therefore, it would be improper to allow an attorney to exploit the
privilege for ends that are antithetical to that process. In the instant
case, the record clearly demonstrates that counsel for the appellant
clandestinely recorded conversations with witnesses. While this practice
violates no law, the Code of Professional Conduct imposes a higher
standard than mere legality. The American Bar Association’s Committee on
Ethics and Professional Responsibility has ruled that the recording of
conversations of witnesses without their consent is unethical. We are
mindful of the client’s interest in protecting against the disclosure of
work product. However, we are unable to say that the disclosure in this
case “traumatized the adversary process more than the underlying legal
misbehavior.” The only discernible effect of the disclosure was that the
depositions of Sharp and Godfrey commenced with the playing of the taped
conversations. We thus hold that whatever work product privilege might
have existed was vitiated by counsel’s clandestine recording of
conversations with witnesses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Carrying the question a step further, one court has recognized the
potential difficulties of the situation in which an attorney directs his
client to engage in behavior that would be improper for the attorney. It
is apparent to this Court that such a course of action on the part of an
attorney would clearly be improper.</p>
<p>In the instant situation, counsel for plaintiffs did not direct Haigh
to undertake the clandestine recordings. As represented to this Court,
he clearly initiated such conduct on his own, and he, of course, is not
bound by the ethical strictures which bind his counsel.</p>
<p>This does not end the question, however. The Court is troubled by
language contained in plaintiff’s memorandum in response to the motion
to compel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Haigh began a concerted effort to interview persons throughout the
United States who may have relevant information relating to his legal
claims. Between February 1987 and October 1987, Haigh has telephoned
approximately fifty-eight such persons and, in most instances, tape
recorded the conversations. The cassette tapes were delivered to counsel
for the plaintiffs within a day or two following each such conversation
and the contents of such tapes reviewed by counsel. In many instances,
the information obtained during such telephone conversations was used by
plaintiffs’ counsel to prepare the initial complaint, the first amended
and restated complaint, and the second amended and restated complaint
filed in this action. Counsel also used such information to prepare
other discovery requests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While counsel did not tell Haigh to initiate or continue taping
conversations, the old adage “actions speak louder than words” comes to
mind. Indeed, Haigh and his attorneys fell into a pattern of conduct
whereby Haigh would tape conversations and almost immediately turn the
tapes over to counsel for their use. This pattern of conduct continued
over a period of approximately nine months, and included the taping of
fifty-eight conversations.</p>
<p>The Court would not be so troubled if it were faced with the
situation where a party, in his exuberance over pending litigation,
pursued such a course of conduct and delivered a handful of tapes to his
counsel. In that situation, the lawyer’s conduct could fairly be
described as simple acquiescence in the situation created by the
client’s exuberance. There is a point, however, where acquiescence
ceases to be passive and noncommittal, and becomes active encouragement
and affirmative support. There is, and can be, no bright line to
determine when this point is reached. Instead, the circumstances of each
case must be viewed in their totality in an attempt to get a fix on that
point. Here, the Court is certain that that point has been crossed. As
such, the Court holds that the work product privilege has been
vitiated.</p>
<p>The ruling today should not be taken as an indictment of counsel’s
ethics or professionalism. To be sure, the law on this point is in an
infant, perhaps even fetal, state. The Court in no way assumes or
believes that counsel’s intent was to run afoul of ethical
strictures.</p>
<p>Additionally, it should be noted that this ruling may be interpreted
by some as punishment for Haigh’s retention of counsel. Indeed, if Haigh
were proceeding pro se, the privilege would not be vitiated. However, an
attorney’s clients may not reap the benefits of the attorney’s expertise
in a vacuum-like state. Rather, the client must realize that the
attorney is bound by a Code of Professional Responsibility, and, when he
retains the attorney, he also retains the responsibilities imposed on
that attorney.</p>
