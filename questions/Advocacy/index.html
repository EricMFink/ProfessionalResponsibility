<h2>1. Meritorious Claims and Defenses</h2>
<section id="question-1.1" class="level3">
<h3>Question 1.1</h3>
<p>Client believes that a city ordinance violates the state constitution
and consults with Lawyer about bringing a suit to challenge the
ordinance. Lawyer explains that, in a similar case ten years ago, the
state Supreme Court held that the ordinance is constitutional. Client
neverless wants to pursue a new challenge and asks if Lawyer will file
the suit. Which of the following statements most accurately describes
Gerald’s options under the Model Rules of Professional Conduct?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Lawyer may file the case as long as he believes that he will
prevail.</li>
<li>Lawyer may not file the case because it is frivolous.</li>
<li>Lawyer may file the case only if a reasonable attorney would
conclude that there is a reasonable chance that the state Supreme Court
will overturn the existing precedent.</li>
<li>Lawyer may file the case as long as he has a good faith argument to
reverse the existing precedent.</li>

<h3>Question 1.2</h3>

“cyber-bullied” on FaceBook. Attorney intends to file a civil suit
against the cyber-bullies to recover damages allegedly caused by their
actions. No court in the jurisdiction has ever considered whether there
is a civil cause of action for cyber-bullying. May Attorney file this
case, consistent with her responsibilities under the Model Rules of
Professional Conduct?</p>
</section>
<section id="question-1.3" class="level3">
<h3>Question 1.3</h3>
<p>Attorney represents Doctor, who believes that Insurance Company has

covered medical procedures. Attorney concludes that there is a
non-frivilous legal and factual basis for the claim, but that the
chances of success are extremely low. Attorney explains this to Doctor,
who replies “I don’t really care about winning, the money isn’t
important to me. But I’m hoping a suit will expose the health insurance
companies’ unscrupulous practices and build support for replacing
private insurance with a”Medicare for All” single-payer national health
insurance program.” If Attorney files the suit, is Attorney subject to
discipline under the Model Rules of Professional Conduct?</p>

<h2>8. Special Responsibilities of Prosecutors</h2>
<section id="question-8.1" class="level3">
<h3>Question 8.1</h3>
<p>Defendant is charged with murder. The crime scene investigation unit
collected DNA samples from the crime scene and had them tested. None of
the samples matched Defendant’s DNA, but did match another person who
had been a suspect. Despite requests by defense counsel, Prosecutor
failed to disclose the DNA test results. Is Prosecutor subject to
discipline?</p>

<section id="question-8.2" class="level3">
<h3>Question 8.2</h3>
<p>Prosecutor plans to run for reelection in 6 months. Last year two
teenage girls were kidnapped from a shopping center. The community was
in an uproar and demanded a conviction. Four months ago, Defendant was
arrested and charged with the kidnapping. The trial is scheduled for
next week. Prosecutor met with the police chief last week and learned
for the first time that, before they were interviewed, the two victims
had been tape-recorded discussing the case. Reviewing the tape,
Prosecutor realized that the girls’ descriptions of the kidnapper
differed significantly. When officially interviewed, however, their
descriptions matched perfectly. Defendant’s lawyer, who had the right to
request access to the prosecution’s investigative file, failed to do so.
Prosecutor reasonably believes Defendant committed the crimes and did
not reveal the existence of the tape to defense counsel.</p>

<h3>Question 8.3</h3>
<p>Ada was the prosecutor in the trial of a defendant charged with
robbery of a convenience store. The defendant denied any involvement,
contending that he was home watching television with his mother on the
night in question. During the trial, Ada called a witness who was in the
convenience store during the robbery. The witness testified that he had
identified Defendant in a police line-up and provided other testimony
connecting Defendant to the crime. Ada also introduced into evidence a
poor-quality surveillance camera recording of the robbery. The jury
convicted the defendant of the robbery. Unknown to the defendant’s
lawyer, the witness had first identified another person in the police
lineup and selected the defendant only after encouragement by the
detective conducting the lineup. Ada was aware of these facts but did
not notify the defendant’s counsel, who made no pretrial discovery
request to obtain this information.</p>
<p>Is Ada subject to discipline?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Yes, unless the jury could make its own identification of the
defendant from the videotape.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because this information tended to negate the defendant’s
guilt.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because the defendant’s counsel made no pretrial discovery
request to obtain this information.</p></li>
<li><p>No, unless it is likely that the jury would have acquitted the
defendant had it known the witness first identified someone
else.</p></li>
