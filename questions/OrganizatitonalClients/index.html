<h3>Question 1</h3>
<p>Attorney, who is corporate counsel for Company, is investigating a
possible theft ring in the parts department of Company. Attorney knows
that Employee has worked in the parts department for a long time and
believes that Employee is a suspect in the thefts. Attorney believes
that if Employee were questioned, Employee would not answer truthfully
if she knew the real purpose of the questions. Consequently, Attorney
plans to question Employee and tell her that she is not a suspect and
that her answers to the questions will be held in confidence.</p>
<p><em>Is this proper?</em></p>
</section>
<section id="question-2" class="level3">
<h3>Question 2</h3>
<p>John, who is employed by ABC as a truck driver, was involved in an
accident last month. The other driver recently sued both ABC and John.
ABC’s president has asked Attorney to handle the litigation. Before
commencing her investigation, Attorney needs to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who does she represent?</li>
<li>May she represent both ABC and John?</li>
<li>Assuming she only represents ABC, will her conversations with the
president be privileged?</li>
<li>What about her conversations with John?</li>
<li>Assume Attorney decides to represent both ABC and John. John tells
Attorney in confidence that he (John) was drinking on the day of the
accident. What are Attorney’s ethical obligations?</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="question-3" class="level3">
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<p>Attorney is an in-house Lawyer at ABC Corporation. Attorney recently
learned that Jill, ABC’s senior vice-president, has been providing
fraudulent financial information to the IRS. If the fraud is discovered,
ABC will face serious civil and criminal penalties.</p>
<p><em>What should Attorney do?</em></p>
