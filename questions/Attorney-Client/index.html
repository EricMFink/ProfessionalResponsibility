<p class="page-title">Attorney-Client Relationship</p>


<section id="question-1" class="level3">
<h3>Question 1</h3>
<p>Father was extremely wealthy. When Father’s son was arrested for
selling drugs, Father wanted to hire the best lawyers in town to
represent the son. Father therefore went to Lawyer’s firm, a prestigious
law firm that practiced almost exclusively in the areas of securities
and banking law. For which of the following reasons may Lawyer’s firm
properly decline to represent Father’s son? Select all that apply:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Father is not one of Lawyer’s firm’s regular clients.</p></li>
<li><p>The firm is not experienced in criminal litigation.</p></li>
<li><p>The firm does not want to devote time and resources to a
potentially high-profile case that might distract from its current
client matters.</p></li>
<li><p>Lawyer never liked Father and does not want to help him.</p></li>
<li><p>Lawyer avoids criminal defense because he believes all drug
dealers are scum and do not deserve the “coddling” they receive in the
criminal justice system.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-2" class="level3">
<h3>Question 2</h3>
<p>When Lawyer moved to her small town after law school, she opened a
solo practice focusing on family law and real estate law. Many of
Lawyer’s clients worked at the local prison, a major employer in this
small town. Despite working long hours, Lawyer was barely making ends
meet. One day, the local Superior Court judge asked Lawyer to serve as
court-appointed counsel in a civil rights claim filed by an inmate at
the local prison alleging abuse by prison guards and neglect by the
Warden. The judge believed that the inmate’s hand-written complaint had
enough merit to proceed, and the judge did not want the inmate to
proceed pro se. The judge told Lawyer, “If you win, you’ll be entitled
to attorney’s fees.” The judge acknowledged, however, that the case
could take months or even years to litigate. For which of the following
reasons may Lawyer properly refuse the appointment from the judge?
Select all that apply:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Lawyer may decline the case if she believes that representing the
inmate may harm her professional reputation in this community.</p></li>
<li><p>Lawyer may decline the case if she in good faith believes she
cannot take the financial risk involved in this representation.</p></li>
<li><p>Lawyer may decline the case because she is not an expert in civil
rights matters.</p></li>
<li><p>Lawyer may decline the case if Lawyer does not like criminals and
believes they deserve what they get in prison.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-3" class="level3">
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<p>Lawyer was retained by the officers of the Industrial Workers Union
to draft new bylaws for the local chapter. Lawyer strongly disagreed
with one of the bylaw provisions that the officers wanted to include.
This provision would prevent the local chapter from voting on some
issues that involve the expenditure of union funds. Lawyer believes that
the provision was lawful and would support the interests of the national
union, but would severely undermine the interests of the local chapter.
Lawyer expressed her disagreement to the union, but the officers
insisted on including this provision. If the union can obtain other
counsel without harm to its interests, may Lawyer withdraw from
representing the local chapter?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Yes, but only if she obtains the consent of her client.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because her client insisted on a course of action with which
Lawyer fundamentally disagreed.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because once Lawyer accepted the representation, she was
obliged to pursue her client’s objectives.</p></li>
<li><p>No, unless the client has breached the agreement under which
Lawyer accepted the representation.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-4" class="level3">
<h3>Question 4</h3>
<p>Lawyer represented Client in a series of loan applications with
banks. Lawyer discovered that Client had falsified information in
previous loan applications. Moreover, when Lawyer confronted Client
about the problem, Client made clear he would submit false loan
applications in the future. Which response most accurately satisfies
Lawyer’s professional responsibility?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Lawyer properly may withdraw from the representation.</p></li>
<li><p>Lawyer may not withdraw from the representation if Client’s
objectives would be frustrated by Lawyer’s withdrawal in the middle of
pending loan applications.</p></li>
<li><p>Lawyer may continue to represent Client if Lawyer decides the
financial benefits of this representation outweigh the costs of Client’s
fraudulent loan applications.</p></li>
<li><p>Lawyer must withdraw from representing client.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-5" class="level3">
<h3>Question 5</h3>
<p>Lawyer consulted with Plaintiff about forming a lawyer-client
relationship in a potential personal injury claim. Plaintiff disclosed
sensitive information about the claim to Lawyer during this
consultation. Lawyer decided not to represent Plaintiff, and Plaintiff
proceeded with a different lawyer. Later, Defendant, the person whom
Plaintiff sued, sought to retain Lawyer’s firm represent Defendant
against Plaintiff’s claim. May Lawyer’s firm properly represent
Defendant in this matter?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Yes, because Lawyer never represented Plaintiff.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because Lawyer obtained information from Plaintiff about this
matter when consulting with Plaintiff.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, if Lawyer is timely and adequately screened from the matter
and another lawyer in Lawyer’s firm represents Defendant.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, if Lawyer obtains informed consent waiving this conflict
from Defendant.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-6" class="level3">
<h3>Question 6</h3>
<p>Lawyer represented Client in a criminal matter. The case went to
trial, and Client decided he wanted to testify. Client also wanted to
call his girlfriend as an alibi witness. Lawyer did not want to call
either Client or the girlfriend as witnesses, believing that the
testimony would hurt Client’s case more than help it. Which response
most accurately describes Lawyer’s professional responsibility in
deciding whether to call Client and his girlfriend as trial
witnesses?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Lawyer may decide, after consultation with Client, whether to
call Client and his girlfriend as witnesses.</p></li>
<li><p>Lawyer may decide, after consultation with Client, whether to
call Client’s girlfriend, but Lawyer must call Client as a trial
witness.</p></li>
<li><p>Client must decide whether he and his girlfriend will testify,
because both decisions qualify as objectives of representation.</p></li>
<li><p>Lawyer must defer to Client’s wishes, because Lawyer worked as an
agent to Client, who was the principal in this relationship. A lawyer
does not operate solely as the client’s agent. See e.g., Model Rules a.2
and b.a.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-7" class="level3">
<h3>Question 7</h3>
<p>Lawyer represented Client in a criminal drug case. The prosecutor
telephoned Lawyer and communicated a “now or never” two-year plea offer
for Client. Lawyer did not tell Client about the offer, because Lawyer
thought the offer was a lousy deal and Client should go to trial.
Several months later as trial was about to begin, the prosecutor
mentioned the previous plea offer in court. Client turned to Lawyer and
said, “Why didn’t you tell me? I might take that offer.” The prosecutor
indicated that the offer actually remained available if Client accepted
it before the trial began. Lawyer consulted with Client, and advised
Client, “I have investigated this case thoroughly. We have a strong
defense. You face only three years if convicted after trial. I think you
should go to trial and reject this offer.” Client followed Lawyer’s
advice and went to trial. Is Lawyer subject to discipline for not
telling Client about the plea offer for several months?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>No, because Client learned of the plea offer ultimately at a time
when he still could accept it, so Client was not prejudiced.</p></li>
<li><p>No, if Lawyer reasonably believed the plea offer was a bad
deal.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because Lawyer had a duty timely to notify Client of a plea
offer in his case.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, but only if Client requested this information.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because Client ultimately rejected the plea offer.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-8" class="level3">
<h3>Question 8</h3>
<p>Lawyer represented Client in a divorce matter. Client told Lawyer, “I
plan to hide some of my assets so I don’t have to pay my ex-spouse as
much money. You work for me, so just do what I say. I’ll take care of
the books, you just argue the assets I report to you.” Lawyer responded
by explaining why Client’s proposed course of action was improper and
the consequences of this course of action. After giving this advice,
Lawyer said, “You sleep on this decision. Call me tomorrow and let me
know whether you have changed your mind.” Is Lawyer subject to
discipline?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Yes, because Lawyer advised Client regarding a crime or fraud
proposed by Client.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because Lawyer was required to withdraw from the
representation once Client requested that Lawyer assist Client in a
crime or fraud.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because Client controlled the objectives of representation
and Lawyer acted merely as an agent to Client’s wishes.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because Client did not propose that Lawyer directly engage in
a crime of fraud.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because Lawyer properly advised Client and awaited a final
decision from Client before deciding whether to withdraw.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-9" class="level3">
<h3>Question 9</h3>
<p>Attorney represents Client, a divorced billionaire. Client instructs
Allman to draft him a new will and to leave all of his estate to his new
wife. Attorney knows that making such a will would put Client in breach
of a written contract to provide funds for the college educations of
CLient’s children by Client’s ex-spouse, even in the event of Client’s
death. Which of the following statements most accurately describes
Attorney’s options under the Model Rules of Professional Conduct?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Attorney must refuse to assist Client because she would be
assisting with a breach of contract.</p></li>
<li><p>Attorney must advise Client that the new will would be a breach
of contract.</p></li>
<li><p>Attorney may draft the will and need not advise her client of the
breach of contract.</p></li>
<li><p>Attorney must advise her client of the breach of contract but
must draft the will if Client insists.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-10" class="level3">
<h3>Question 10</h3>
<p>Attorney is defending Star Enterprises, Inc. (SEI) in a civil case in
which SEI is accused of fraud. Meanwhile, SEI is applying to a local
bank for an extension on its line of credit, and SEI has asked Attorney
to prepare and deliver a written report to the bank about the
transaction that was allegedly fraudulent. Which of the following
statements most accurately describes the lawyer’s options under the
Model Rules of Professional Conduct?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Attorney may prepare and deliver the evaluation with the informed
consent of his client.</p></li>
<li><p>Attorney may not perform the evaluation for the bank because
doing so is incompatible with his role as advocate for SEI.</p></li>
<li><p>Attorney may perform and deliver the evaluation to the bank as
long as the report does not affect SEI’s interests materially and
adversely.</p></li>
<li><p>Attorney may not prepare and deliver the evaluation to the bank
because he would be revealing information relating to the representation
of his client.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-11" class="level3">
<h3>Question 11</h3>
<p>A lawyer has represented Monolith, Incorporated for a number of
years. She receives a call from the general counsel for Monolith, an
experienced attorney who is a highly sophisti cated consumer of legal
services. The general counsel asks the lawyer, “may we compensate an
official of a foreign government for his consulting services in
connection with our export of products into his country. Don’t preach to
me — I just want technical legal advice on that question.” Which of the
following statements most accurately reflects the lawyer’s options under
the Model Rules of Professional Conduct?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The lawyer may always give clients technical legal advice if the
client is clear that this is all the client wants.</p></li>
<li><p>The lawyer must not accept the question at face value but instead
must probe the client’s plan to see if more detailed advice is
necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>The lawyer must never give a client just technical legal
advice.</p></li>
<li><p>The lawyer may accept the request at face value and give just the
technical legal advice requested.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-12" class="level3">
<h3>Question 12</h3>
<p>Attorney specializes in prenuptial agreements. Her client, Client is
a divorced mother of two girls. Client is about to marry Pat, the single
parent of two much younger boys. Client instructs Attorney to write a
prenuptial agreement that will require Pat to fund the girls’ higher
education fully (including graduate or professional school), regardless
of the girls’ other means and regardless of Pat’s ability to provide for
his boys. Which of the following statements most accurately describes
Attorney’s options under the Model Rules of Professional Conduct?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Attorney may but need not counsel Client on the morality of such
an agreement.</p></li>
<li><p>Attorney must counsel Client on the morality of such an
agreement.</p></li>
<li><p>Attorney may not counsel Client on the morality of the agreement
because moral advice is not part of the lawyer’s role.</p></li>
<li><p>Attorney must decline to assist Client in making such an
agreement.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-13" class="level3">
<h3>Question 13</h3>
<p>Attorney has been asked by a client to undertake a title search and
provide an opinion to third parties about the marketability of her
client’s property. Under the Model Rules of Professional Conduct, which
of the following statements most accurately describes Attorney’s duties
to the third parties?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Attorney has the same duties to the third parties that Attorney
would have to a client because Attorney knows that the third parties are
relying upon Attorney’s opinion.</p></li>
<li><p>Attorney’s duties to third parties are governed by other law and
not the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p></li>
<li><p>Attorney has only the duty not to make a false statement of
material fact to the third parties.</p></li>
<li><p>Attorney has no duties to the third parties because they are not
clients.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-14" class="level3">
<h3>Question 14</h3>
<p>Attorney is representing Defendant on charges of drug trafficking.
The judge in the case has just denied Ruiz’s motion to suppress the
evidence against his client, and it appears that conviction, followed by
a long prison term, is likely if the case goes to trial. The only
alternative is for Defendant to make a deal with the prosecution,
testify against her friends, and seek a lighter sentence. Fernando knows
that Defendant will be distraught about this news and will hate the idea
of cooperating with the prosecution. What is Fernando’s duty as a
counselor to Defendant?</p>
</section>
<section id="question-15" class="level3">
<h3>Question 15</h3>
<p>Attorney has been asked by his client, the owner of a rare book
store, to give the client’s bank a legal opinion that the client is in
compliance with various loan covenants. As Attorney proceeds with the
investigation, it becomes clear that the client has no intention of
ating and giving Attorney all the documentation that Attorney needs. It
seems clear to Attorney that if he presses for more information, he will
be fired. Under the Model Rules of Professional Conduct, what advice
should Attorney give to his client about the legal opinion he will have
to give under these circumstances?</p>
