<section id="question-1" class="level3">
<h3>Question 1</h3>
<p>Your long-time client, John Carter, recently came to your office to
tell you that he expects to be sued by the person who bought his house.
He had told the buyer that the house had a dry basement. Although the
basement had never flooded in the five years that he had lived there,
Carter had been told by a prior owner that the basement regularly
flooded after a heavy rain. There was such a rain this year, and the
buyer’s furniture was destroyed.</p>
<p>Shortly before his death, you were able to interview the prior owner
of the house, who told you what he had told Carter about the flooding.
You have notes of that interview in which you comment on the former
owner’s likely credibility at trial. In addition, while at a party,
Carter’s banker let slip that Carter is in bad financial condition. The
buyer has now filed suit against Carter.</p>
<ul>
<li>The buyer has subpoenaed you to give a deposition. What information
must you disclose?</li>
<li>The buyer has subpoenaed any documents you have related to the case.
What must you disclose?</li>
<li>One of your college friends, who is about to loan money to Carter,
has informally asked you about Carter’s financial condition. You would
like to help your college friend. What may you disclose?</li>
<li>If Carter is compelled to testify at trial, may he use the
attorney-client privilege as a basis for refusing to disclose the
conversation he had with the prior owner?</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="question-2" class="level3">
<h3>Question 2</h3>
<p>In a federal investigation of Defendant for tax fraud, the grand jury
by subpoena requests a letter written January 15 by Defendant to her
attorney in which she stated: “Please prepare a deed giving my ranch to
University but, in order to get around the tax law, I want it back-dated
to December 15.”</p>
<p>Must attorney produce the letter?</p>
</section>
<section id="question-3" class="level3">
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<p>Attorney represents Client in a civil commitment proceeding. During a
break in the proceeding, Client confidentially tells Attorney that he
(Client) intends to commit suicide at the next break. Attorney, who
believes Client will carry out the threat, would like to inform the
appropriate authorities.</p>
<p>May Attorney do so?</p>
</section>
<section id="question-4" class="level3">
<h3>Question 4</h3>
<p>On June 1, Owner consults Attorney about a motor vehicle collision
resulting in a suit by P against Owner. Attorney calls E, an expert he
has hired to testify in this case, into the conference to make notes of
what is said, and those present discuss the facts of the collision. A
few weeks later, Attorney is subpoenaed by the grand jury and asked to
disclose the substance of her June 1 conversation with Owner.</p>
<p>Must Attorney disclose such information?</p>
</section>
<section id="question-5" class="level3">
<h3>Question 5</h3>
<p>You are an attorney who represents Curtis, a wealthy real estate
developer. Curtis has been charged with tax fraud and the District
Attorney has served a subpoena directing you to produce some private
bank records that Curtis gave you for safekeeping.</p>
<p><em>Must you produce the records?</em></p>
</section>
<section id="question-6" class="level3">
<h3>Question 6</h3>
<p>An attorney represents a company that produces chemical products.
Some of the waste products that the company manufactures are highly
toxic and are likely to cause serious immediate physical harm if
disposed of improperly. The president of the company recently informed
the attorney that a new employee mistakenly disposed of the waste
products in the ground behind the company plant, an area that is part of
the source of the city’s water supply. The attorney advised the
president that the company could be liable for negligence in lawsuits
brought by any persons harmed by the waste products. As a result, the
attorney advised the president to immediately report the problem to city
authorities. Fearful of adverse publicity, the president declined to do
so. The attorney further advised the president that she believed the
president’s decision was immoral. The president continued to decline to
report the matter. The attorney then informed the president that she was
withdrawing from the representation and would inform the authorities
herself. Immediately after withdrawing, the attorney reported the
company’s conduct to the authorities.</p>
<p>Is the attorney subject to discipline?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Yes, because the information was given to the attorney in confidence
and may not be revealed without the client’s consent.</li>
<li>Yes, unless the company’s conduct was criminal.</li>
<li>No, because the attorney reasonably believed that the company’s
disposal of the waste products was likely to cause serious physical
harm.</li>
<li>No, because the attorney reasonably believed that the president was
pursuing an imprudent course of conduct.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-7" class="level3">
<h3>Question 7</h3>
<p>Attorney represented Client in a large real estate deal. Buyer, who
purchased the real estate from Client, has filed suit against both
Client and Attorney, alleging fraud. Attorney had advised Client by
letter against making the statements relied upon by Buyer as the basis
of Buyer’s claim. In her defense to Buyer’s suit, Attorney wishes to
reveal confidential information imparted to Attorney by Client that will
be favorable to Attorney but damaging to Client.</p>
<p>May Attorney do so?</p>
</section>
<section id="question-8" class="level3">
<h3>Question 8</h3>
<p>Client, who is a fugitive from justice, is seeking an attorney to
represent him. Client visits Lawyer for a free initial consultation.
During the meeting, Client admits guilt. At the end of the meeting,
however, Client decides not to hire Lawyer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is Lawyer required or allowed to disclose Client’s admission of
guilt?</li>
<li>What if, unbeknownst to Client, Lawyer had never passed the bar exam
and thus was not a licensed attorney?</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="question-9" class="level3">
<h3>Question 9</h3>
<p>John, who is employed by ABC as a truck driver, was involved in an
accident last month. The other driver recently sued both ABC and John.
Attorney, who represents ABC Corp., but not John, meets separately with
both John and ABC’s President, as part of her case preparation.</p>
<p>Which of the communications are covered by the attorney-client
privilege?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Attorney’s communications with the president</li>
<li>Attorney’s communications with John</li>
<li>Both</li>
<li>Neither</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-10" class="level3">
<h3>Question 10</h3>
<p>You are a public defender representing Jerry Cashwell, who has been
charged with murder. Based on witness statements, the police and
prosecutor believe that another man, Lee Hunt, planned the murder and
that Cashwell acted as Hunt’s accomplice in carrying out the killing. To
avoid any potential conflict, the court has appointed another lawyer to
represent Hunt.</p>
<p>During your initial meeting with Cashwell, he tells you, “I killed
that guy all on my own. Hunt didn’t have anything to do with it.” Based
on the details that Cashwell provides about the crime, and the lack of
any apparent motive to falsely claim sole responsibility, you conclude
that Cashwell is telling the truth.</p>
<p><em>What are your obligations under Rule 1.6(a)? Do any of the
exceptions under Rule 1.6(b) apply at this point?</em></p>
<p>Cashwell and Hunt are tried separately. At Hunt’s trial, he testifies
that he had no role in the crime. Nevertheless, Hunt is convicted and
sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>
<p>Following Hunt’s conviction, you reach an agreement with the
prosecution under which Cashwell will plead guilty to the murder charge
and receive a life sentence. The prosecutor tells you they are offering
this deal, “because we know Cashwell &amp; Hunt acted together”. You
notify Cashwell of the plea offer and explain to him that, if he goes to
trial and it comes out that he acted alone, he would likely face the
death penalty. Cashwell accepts the deal and enters a guilty plea. At
Cashwell’s allocution, he does not reveal that Hunt had no
involvement.</p>
<p><em>Do you have any obligation to correct the prosecutor’s mistaken
belief about Hunt’s involvement in the murder? Do you have any
obligation to inform the court that Hunt was not involved?</em></p>
<p>About ten years later, Cashwell commits suicide in prison. Hunt
remains in prison serving his life sentence.</p>
<p><em>Does MRPC Rule 1.6 permit you to reveal Cashwell’s admission of
sole responsbility to Hunt’s attorney now that Cashwell is
dead?</em></p>
<p><em>Does NC Rule 8.6 permit or require disclosure?</em></p>
</section>
<section id="question-11" class="level3">
<h3>Question 11</h3>
<p>In which of the following circumstances would the information be
covered by both the duty of confidentiality and the attorney-client
evidentiary privilege? Select all that apply:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Lawyer represented Client in a tax matter. With Client’s consent,
Lawyer hired an accountant to examine Client’s tax records, consult with
Client, and prepare reports for Lawyer to use in representing
Client.</li>
<li>Lawyer represented Client in a property dispute concerning a
boundary line dispute. When Lawyer reviewed county land records, Lawyer
discovered that the person who sold the property to Client did not have
full legal title to the property.</li>
<li>Lawyer represented Client in a drunk driving case. Lawyer
interviewed the bartender at the bar from which Client drove home on the
night in question. The bartender told Lawyer that he saw Client consume
five drinks.</li>
<li>Lawyer represented Client in a breach of contract case. When
investigating Client’s case, Lawyer found a newspaper article reporting
a bad business deal in which Client was involved several years ago.</li>
<li>Lawyer represented Client in a murder case. During Lawyer’s first
office consultation with Client, Client confessed to killing the victim.
Client spoke Spanish, so Lawyer retained an interpreter to be present
during the consultation.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-12" class="level3">
<h3>Question 12</h3>
<p>Lawyer represented many clients in a broad range of legal matters,
such as family law, criminal law, and landlord tenant law cases. To stay
in prompt contact with all these clients, Lawyer used text messaging
rather than rely on a traditional office telephone system. Is Lawyer
subject to discipline for using text messaging with her clients?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Yes, because text messaging violates a lawyer’s duty of
confidentiality.</li>
<li>No, if the clients agreed to text messaging.</li>
<li>No, because any form of communication a lawyer chooses is impliedly
authorized by the representation.<br>
</li>
<li>No, if Lawyer consulted with the clients about the risks and limits
of text messaging, and competently and diligently investigated the
security of the text messaging system and ensures that it is not used
for sensitive communications that cannot be adequately protected from
outside access.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-13" class="level3">
<h3>Question 13</h3>
<p>Several years ago, you represented Client in a homicide
investigation. Client privately confessed to the killing, but the
investigation never resulted in a criminal charge. Years later, you
represented Client in a child custody dispute between Client and her
ex-spouse. Client’s ex-spouse sought full custody and claimed that
Client was not an effective or safe parent, in part because of the
homicide investigation. The family court judge ruled that the homicide
investigation was not relevant, because Client never was charged. You
have no information that Client ever has harmed, threatened, or
neglected her children. What is your professional responsibility in this
circumstance according to Model Rule 1.6?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>You must disclose Client’s confession to the murder if disclosure is
in the children’s best interests.</li>
<li>You may disclose Client’s confession to the murder if disclosure is
in the children’s best interests.</li>
<li>You must not disclose Client’s confession to the murder.</li>
<li>You may disclose that Client committed the murder to Client’s
ex-spouse, but only if you disclose this information anonymously.</li>
<li>You must disclose Client’s confession to the murder if you
subjectively fear that Client may be dangerous to the children.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-14" class="level3">
<h3>Question 14</h3>
<p>Lawyer represented Client briefly on a serious drug charge. During
one consultation, Client said to Lawyer, “I really should kill the
witness in this case–it would solve all my problems.” Lawyer responded,
“Terrible idea. I don’t have to tell you how serious that crime would
be, and it would make your situation a million times worse.” Client
replied, “I hear you. Forget I said anything about it.” Lawyer and
Client resumed their discussion of how to defend the drug charge. A few
weeks later, Lawyer learned that the witness was murdered. Lawyer
promptly withdrew from representing Client. Client was charged with this
murder, and the prosecutor subpoenaed Lawyer to testify at Client’s
murder trial, because the prosecutor suspected that Lawyer had relevant
information about Client’s intent to kill the witness. How should Lawyer
respond to the subpoena when Lawyer appears before the judge as a
witness?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>“Your Honor, I cannot answer the prosecutor’s questions, because
this information is confidential.”</li>
<li>“Your Honor, because of the crime-fraud exception to the
attorney-client privilege, I will answer the prosecutor’s
questions.”</li>
<li>“Your Honor, I cannot answer the prosecutor’s questions and I
request an ex parte, sealed hearing on my client’s attorney-client
privilege claim.”</li>
<li>“Your Honor, I will answer the prosecutor’s questions unless
Client’s current lawyer objects.”</li>
<li>“Your Honor, I will not answer the prosecutor’s questions, because a
prosecutor never can make a lawyer testify against his or her own client
in a criminal case.”</li>
<li>“Your Honor, I can answer the prosecutor’s questions, because I am
no longer Client’s lawyer.”</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-15" class="level3">
<h3>Question 15</h3>
<p>Lawyer represented Client in a high-value commercial real estate sale
to another party. After the transaction was completed, Lawyer learned
that Client falsified several documents relating to the value and
suitability of the property. Lawyer negotiated from these documents on
Client’s behalf in securing the deal with the purchaser. What response
most accurately identifies Lawyer’s professional responsibility?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Lawyer must not disclose the falsity of the documents because this
information is confidential.</li>
<li>Lawyer may disclose the falsity of the documents because this
information is not confidential under the crime-fraud exception.</li>
<li>Lawyer may disclose the falsity of the documents, but only if the
purchaser faces future financial harm from Client’s fraud that
disclosure could prevent.</li>
<li>Lawyer may disclose the falsity of the documents to mitigate or
rectify the harm that Client caused to the purchaser.</li>
<li>Lawyer must disclose the falsity of the documents to protect the
purchaser’s financial interests.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-16" class="level3">
<h3>Question 16</h3>
<p>A public defender is representing the defendant in a murder case. In
investigating the case, the public defender gathers indisputable
evidence from a relative of the client that the client committed a
murder for which another man has been sentenced to life in prison
without parole. Which of the following statements best describes the
lawyer’s options under the Model Rules of Professional Conduct?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>The lawyer must disclose her client’s guilt if she reasonably
believes that doing so is necessary to remedy the wrongful conviction of
the other man</li>
<li>The lawyer may disclose her client’s guilt because the information
is not covered by the attorney-client privilege.</li>
<li>The lawyer may not disclose his client’s guilt without her client’s
permission because that is information relating to the representation of
her client.</li>
<li>The lawyer may disclose her client’s guilt if she reasonably
believes that doing so is necessary to prevent substantial bodily harm
to the innocent man.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-17" class="level3">
<h3>Question 17</h3>
<p>An attorney is outside counsel to Solar Panels, Inc. (SPI), a company
that is engaged in the design and production of experimental solar
panels for the generation of electricity in the American southwest. A
new president of SPI instructs the lawyer to investigate rumors that SPI
has defrauded its customers with false reports of the efficiency and
cost effectiveness of SPI’s products. The attorney conducts the
investigation and concludes that the allegations are true and that SPI
perpetrated this fraud without the knowledge or assistance of any of its
lawyers. The attorney strongly believes that it is in SPI’s interest to
reveal publicly what the prior management of the company did, in order
to try to protect the company’s credibility with investors, the
government, and the public. The attorney is further convinced that
continued silence would cause enormous harm to the company when the
truth inevitably comes out. The attorney takes his concerns to the
officers and Board of Directors of SPI, but the attorney is instructed
to remain silent. Which of the following statements most accurately
reflects the attorney’s options under the Model Rules of Professional
Conduct?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>The attorney may not reveal the information because the client has
refused to consent to the disclosure.</li>
<li>The attorney may not reveal the fraud publicly because the lawyer’s
services were not used in connection with the fraud and the attorney
learned the information while conducting an investigation for SPI.</li>
<li>The attorney may reveal the information publicly because the
attorney reasonably believes that doing so is necessary to prevent
substantial injury to the organization.</li>
<li>The attorney may reveal the information because the client has
perpetrated a fraud that caused substantial financial injury to
others.</li>
</ol>
