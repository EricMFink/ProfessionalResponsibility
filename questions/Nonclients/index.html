<section id="question-1" class="level3">
<h3>Question 1</h3>

responsibilities under the Model Rules of Professional Conduct?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Attorney may not make the statement because it is a false statement
of material fact.</li>

<h3>Question 2</h3>
<p>Attorney represents the Downtown Realty Company (DRC) in a series of
property deals that are about to close. Attorney has just learned that
the client fraudulently altered the inspection reports on the properties
that it is selling, and upon which the buyers are relying. The client
cannot be dissuaded from closing the transactions, and the buyers will
suffer significant financial harm if the sales close. Which of the
following statements most accurately states Attorney’s responsibilities
under the Model Rules of Professional Conduct?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Attorney must withdraw from representing DRC and must inform the
buyers of the fraud if disclosure is necessary to avoid assisting in the
fraud.</li>

buyers of the fraud because that information is confidential.</li>

<h3>Question 3</h3>
<p>Attorney represents Bluebird Paint Company. Bluebird has been sued
for employment discrimination by a woman who has been using her work
e-mail account to send questions about the suit to and receive answers
from her attorney. Under Bluebird’s written company policy, Bluebird has
the right to inspect and copy any messages sent or received on Bluebird
e-mail accounts. A Bluebird executive copies the plaintiff’s messages to
and from her lawyer and sends those messages to Attorney. Which of the

messages unless other law requires him to do so.</li>

means of obtaining evidence that violate the rights of the
plaintiff.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-4" class="level3">
<h3>Question 4</h3>
<p>Attorney is representing a wife in a child custody dispute. Attorney
receives an e-mail message from a woman who is a Facebook “friend” of
the husband. The e-mail message attaches a photo copied from the
husband’s Facebook account in which the husband appears to be smoking
marijuana. The friend attaches another in which the husband appears to
be dancing nude on a beach with several other people in a similar state
of undress. Attorney can reasonably assume that if he uses these photos
at the custody hearing the husband will suffer serious embarrassment and
perhaps lose his job as a counselor at a parochial school. Which of the
following most accurately describes Attorney’s options under the Model
Rules of Professional Conduct?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Attorney may use the photos because he did not obtain them
illegally.</li>
<li>Attorney may not use the photos because he would cause the husband
embarrassment.</li>
<li>Attorney may use the photos because he has a substantial purpose
other than embarrassing the husband.</li>
<li>Attorney may not use the photos unless his sole purpose in doing so
is to demonstrate that his client should have custody of the
children.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-5" class="level3">
<h3>Question 5</h3>
<p>Attorney is eager to resolve a claim that is pending against his
client in bankruptcy. Attorney knows that the claim will not be
dischargeable in bankruptcy as long as the claimant files a claim by the
deadline. His opposing counsel is a young, inexperienced lawyer who
knows little about the intricacies of bankruptcy law. Attorney tells
this young lawyer that if she files a claim it will just be discharged
under bankruptcy law. Which of the following statements most accurately
describes the propriety of this statement under the Model Rules of
Professional Conduct?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>The statement is not misconduct because no reasonable lawyer would
rely upon opposing counsel to accurately state the law that will apply
to a dispute.</li>
<li>The statement is not misconduct because it is not a false statement
of material fact,</li>
<li>The statement is misconduct because of the disparity in knowledge
and experience between the two lawyers.</li>
<li>The statement is misconduct because it is a false statement of
law.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-6" class="level3">
<h3>Question 6</h3>

number of clearly privileged communications between the company’s
lawyers and senior company officials. Which of the following statements
most accurately describes the propriety of Attorney’s conduct under the

<h3>Question 7</h3>
<p>Attorney is investigating a claim for a client about an accident on

that Acme expects litigation and is represented by counsel in the
matter. Attorney wants to speak to an employee of Acme without having to
tell Acme’s lawyer about the interviews. The employee works on Acme’s
loading dock and had nothing to do with the accident, except that the
witness may have seen what happened when Attorney’s client fell. Which
of the following statements most accurately describes Attorney’s options
under the Model Rules of Professional Conduct?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Attorney may talk to the employee without notifying Acme’s counsel

works for Acme.</li>
</ol>

<ol type="a">
<li>Attorney may continue the conversation as long as he informs

</ol>
</section>

under the Model Rules of Professional Conduct?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Attorney may counsel the client to do the taping as long as doing so
is legal in their jurisdiction.</li>
<li>Attorney may counsel the client to tape the conversation because

</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-10" class="level3">
<h3>Question 10</h3>

</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-11" class="level3">
<h3>Question 11</h3>
<p>Attorney is representing a client in a civil case involving an
alleged breach of contract. A crucial issue in the case will be what the
parties intended by certain provisions in their complicated contract. In
discovery, Attorney has received an electronic version of the contract
from her adversary’s attorney. Attorney is informed that he can access
certain “meta-data” in that contract, which may include revisions and
comments that were made by the opposing party (and not its counsel)
during the negotiations over the contract. May Attorney take steps to
access this “meta-data,” consistent with his obligations under the Model
Rules of Professional Conduct?</p>
</section>
<section id="question-12" class="level3">
<h3>Question 12</h3>
<p>Attorney represents the wife in a divorce case. The husband is
represented by counsel, Attorney’s client is tired of paying hefty legal
bills and tired of seeing the marital estate dissipated by the similarly
hefty legal bills that her husband is paying. Attorney wants to suggest
to her client that the client approach the husband directly about
resolving all issues by agreement. Attorney could coach her client on
how to approach the husband and how best to negotiate a good deal. Is
Attorney’s plan consistent with her responsibilities under the Model
Rules of Professional Conduct?</p>
</section>
<section id="question-13" class="level3">
<h3>Question 13</h3>
<p>Attorney is in the midst of trying to negotiate the settlement of a
civil claim with the assistance of a mediator. The mediator, who is not
a judge, is conducting the settlement negotiations in a “caucus” format,
and is shuttling back and forth between the parties. Ordinarily,
Attorney would feel free in a negotiation to bluff about her settlement
authority by telling the plaintiff’s counsel that she cannot exceed a
certain payment, even if her authority is actually for a greater amount.
May Attorney engage in this tactic in a caucused mediation?</p>
