<section id="question-1.1" class="level3">
<h3>Question 1.1</h3>
<p>Spencer, a businessman, calls Kai, an attorney. He says he is looking
for a lawyer so that he can sue his former business partner, Max, with
whom he has had a falling out. He asserts that he has proof that Max was
stealing money from his company and covering it up by keeping two sets
of books. Spencer says he has photos of several pages from both sets of
books, which he obtained by sneaking into Max’s house, where he found
the books in the study and photographed them with his cell phone. Kai
makes an appointment to meet with Spencer the following week to discuss
possible representation.</p>
<p>The day after the phone call, Max calls Kai to ask for representation
because he thinks Spencer is going to sue him. Max offers Kai a generous
flat fee for the work. Kai would like to represent Max.</p>
<p>May Kai represent Max without Spencer’s consent?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>No, because an attorney may not accept representation of a person
where the attorney’s representation has first been requested by a
potential adversary of that person.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because Spencer has given Kai information that could be used
adversely to Spencer if Kai represents Max.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because there is no conflict of interest, since Kai has not
yet agreed to represent Spencer.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because Spencer’s actions were not lawful.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Question 1.2</h3>
<p>Attorney Charlie works at a law firm of 30 lawyers in a large city.
He represents his friend Suma in a wrongful discharge suit against her
former employer, an architecture firm. Suma and her husband, Todd, are
in the process of divorcing. Suma has retained a family lawyer
associated with another firm to represent her in the divorce case.
Charlie just learned that one of his law partners, Angus, is
representing Todd in the divorce. Charlie and Angus agreed not to
communicate with one another about either of the matters. They did not
speak to Suma and Todd about the conflict. May Charlie continue to
represent Suma in her civil suit against her former employer?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Yes, because Charlie and Angus agreed not to communicate with one
another about either of the matters.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because the conflict involves only Charlie’s personal
interests and does not present a significant risk of materially limiting
Angus’s representation of Todd.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because the firm did not obtain both clients’ informed
consent, confirmed in writing.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because law firms are not permitted to sue current
clients.</p></li>
</ol>

<section id="question-1.3" class="level3">
<h3>Question 1.3</h3>
<p>Attorney Pavel is a criminal defense lawyer representing Denny, who
is charged with larceny. Denny, a pro bono client, is alleged to have
stolen a piece of jewelry from a jewelry box during a house party. In an
unrelated matter, Pavel is defending Betty, for a fee, against a
criminal charge of arson. Both cases are assigned to be heard by a
single judge. During Denny’s trial, the prosecutor calls Betty to the
stand. She testifies that she was at the party in question and saw Denny
go in and out of the room where the alleged theft occurred. She further
testifies that she never went into that room. Earlier, Denny had told
Pavel that he saw Betty go into the room, and he suggested that she may
be the thief. Pavel intends to cross-examine Betty on this point. Is
there a conflict of interest?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Yes, because Denny’s interests are directly adverse to
Betty’s.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because Betty is a paying client.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because the representation does not involve the assertion of
a claim by Denny against Betty or vice-versa.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because Pavel’s cross-examination of Betty is impliedly
authorized to carry out the representation.</p></li>

<h3>Question 1.4</h3>
<p>Attorney Roger is a solo practitioner in a small town. There are only
about 70 lawyers in the town, and of those, only 20 (including Roger)
handle divorce cases. One day, Roger does an intake interview with Leon,
who is seeking a divorce. Leon reveals to Roger that he had several
affairs during his marriage and that his wife, Reva, does not know about
them. At the end of the interview, Roger tells Leon that he will let
Leon know within a week whether he can accept his case.</p>
<p>The next day, Leon calls Roger to say that he has decided to retain
another lawyer. A week later, Reva comes to Roger’s office seeking
representation in the divorce. Recognizing her name, and before she says
anything else, he asks her if Leon is her spouse. She confirms that he
is. Roger immediately tells Reva that he may not be able to represent
her. Before he can finish his sentence, Reva interrupts, “Is this
because he came to see you already? I have already been told by five
different lawyers that they cannot represent me because of a conflict of
interest! I think Leon is just trying to prevent me from hiring a lawyer
in this town.” A few days later, Roger is able to confirm that over the
course of three days, Leon did a one-hour intake interview with every
divorce lawyer in town.</p>
<p>May Roger represent Reva in the divorce?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Yes, because Leon is only a prospective client; therefore Roger
owes no duty to him.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because Leon met with every divorce lawyer in town.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because Roger received information from Leon that could be
used against Leon.</p></li>
<li><p>No, unless he gets Leon’s informed consent, confirmed in
writing.</p></li>

<h3>Question 1.5</h3>
<p>Attorney Meghan represents Walter, a used-car salesman who has been
criminally charged with driving while intoxicated. Before Walter’s
trial, a friend of Meghan’s, Laurel, asks Meghan to represent her in her
breach of contract suit against Walter and his company. If Meghan were
to sue Walter on behalf of Laurel, another lawyer would defend Walter in
that matter. Meghan has formed a close bond with Walter as a result of
her work on his criminal case, and she reasonably believes that she
could not represent Laurel very vigorously, because of her friendship
with Walter. She explains her concern to Laurel, and Laurel states that
she understands the risks and agrees to the representation anyway. She
confirms her understanding in writing. Walter also gives informed
consent in writing. May Meghan represent Laurel?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Yes, because the representation is not prohibited by
law.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because Walter’s case is criminal and Laurel’s case is
civil.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because the representation would involve the assertion of a
claim by one client against another client represented by the lawyer in
the same litigation.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because Meghan does not reasonably believe that she can
competently and diligently represent Walter and Laurel, even though both
clients gave informed consent, confirmed in writing.</p></li>

<h3>Question 1.6</h3>
<p>The state in which Stella practices recently enacted an animal
cruelty law. Stella represents Chix, Inc., a poultry company, in a suit
brought by a local animal rights group. The suit alleges that the
poultry company has violated the new state law by failing to provide
adequate ventilation in the chicken coops. The suit seeks punitive
damages. Stella files a motion to strike the punitive damages request,
urging that the new law does not allow recovery of punitive damages.</p>
<p>In an unrelated matter, Stella represents a group of students at a
small Christian college, seeking to recover punitive damages against the
school for allowing dissection of live animals in their school’s biology
classes in violation of the statute. When Stella agreed to represent the
students, she explained to them that she was arguing against the
availability of punitive damages in the Chix case. Stella is
representing the students pro bono, so even if punitive damages were
granted, she would not receive a portion of the award as a legal
fee.</p>
<p>Which of the following factors is least relevant to determining the
risk that Stella’s actions on behalf of one client would materially
limit Stella’s effectiveness in representing the other?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>The fact that she will represent both clients in lawsuits at the
trial court level.</p></li>
<li><p>The fact that the lawsuits will be litigated during the same
period of time.</p></li>
<li><p>The fact that Stella would not benefit financially if the statute
were interpreted to allow punitive damages.</p></li>
<li><p>The fact that, when Stella agreed to represent the students, she
explained to them that she was arguing against the availability of
punitive damages in the Chix case.</p></li>

<section id="question-1.7" class="level3">
<h3>Question 1.7</h3>
<p>Chloe and Matilda are partners in a small law firm. Chloe has
represented Speisler Motors, an auto manufacturer, for years. She
represents Speisler in all litigation in which it is a party. At present
she is defending the company in a lawsuit brought by Tom, a driver of a
Speisler car who was blinded when an airbag spontaneously exploded while
he was driving. When the bag exploded, Tom’s car hit Anton, a
pedestrian, who died some days after the accident. The executor of
Anton’s estate has asked Matilda to represent the estate in a lawsuit
against Tom and Speisler Motors. Matilda believes that she would be able
to provide competent and diligent representation to Anton’s estate, and
Chloe believes that she would be able to provide competent and diligent
representation to Speisler Motors. They have agreed not to talk with
each other or to share documents relating to the matter. Speisler, Tom,
and Anton’s executor all give verbal consent to the representation after
full disclosure of all material risks. Is it proper for Matilda to
accept representation of Anton’s estate?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Yes, because Matilda could reasonably believe that she would be
able to provide competent and diligent representation to Anton’s estate,
and Chloe could reasonably believe that she would be able to provide
competent and diligent representation to Speisler Motors.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because Matilda and Chloe have agreed not to talk with each
other or to share documents relating to the matter.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because although the conflict is consentable, neither Matilda
nor Chloe confirmed her client’s informed consent in writing.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because there is a conflict of interest and the conflict is
not consentable.</p></li>

<section id="question-1.8" class="level3">
<h3>Question 1.8</h3>
<p>Valladia, Inc., is a small, closely held corporation. Valladia and
its president, Alan, are defendants in a civil action brought by a state
attorney general who accuses both of them of fraud, based on the same
facts and the same law. Both of them desire to be represented by Martha,
an attorney. Martha will bill each defendant for services provided on
behalf of that defendant. Martha reasonably believes that she could
provide competent and diligent representation to both of them. Martha
advises the board of directors of Valladia of all the foreseeable risks
of the corporation being represented by the same attorney who is
representing Alan, and she advises Alan of all of the foreseeable risks
of being represented by the lawyer who is representing the board.
Valladia’s board of directors votes to approve the representation, and
Alan approves as well. Martha writes a letter to the corporation and to
Alan noting that both have given their informed consent to her
representation of both parties. May Martha represent both of them?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Yes, because the corporation gave informed consent to the joint
representation.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because both defendants gave informed consent to the joint
representation.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because a single lawyer may not represent two co-defendants
in civil litigation.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because even though conflicts are not foreseeable at present,
they could arise in the future.</p></li>

<h3>Question 2.1</h3>
<p>Carlos, a sole practitioner, represents Sharky Products, Inc., a
property owner that disputes an adjoining owner’s right of access to an
alleyway between their buildings. Carlos sent a letter to the other
property owner, Berry’s Beauty Supply Co., to explain the problem. He
received a reply from Berry’s lawyer, Eleanor, requesting that Carlos
withdraw from representation of Sharky. Eleanor claimed that Carlos was
prohibited from handling this matter because five years ago, Carlos
represented Matthew, the president and sole owner of Berry’s, in a claim
against the manufacturer of a lawn care product that he used at his
home. The matter took three hours of Carlos’ time and Matthew was
satisfied with the resulting settlement. Carlos has had no contact with
Matthew since then.</p>
<p>May Carlos continue to represent Sharky Products, Inc.?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Yes, because there is no substantial relationship between the two
matters.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because he only worked on Matthew’s case for three
hours.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because his representation of Sharky is materially adverse to
his former client.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because Matthew is the president and sole owner of
Berry’s.</p></li>

<h3>Question 2.2</h3>
<p>Last year, attorney Mira represented Sally, the owner of a small
pizza restaurant, in a suit against Rome’s Own, Inc., a supplier of
shredded cheese, based on breach of contract. The parties settled the
claim for $15,000. Mira and Sally remained friendly after the matter was
settled, and have gone to the movies and to dinner a few times in the
last year. Earlier today, Sally’s next door neighbor, Jose, came in to
Mira’s office for a consultation and asked Mira to represent him in a
civil suit against Sally. Jose alleges that Sally’s pet macaw bit him,
causing an infection and permanent scarring. Jose wants to get a court
order against Sally requiring that the bird be euthanized pursuant to a
state law. Sally already paid for his medical care. Jose does not want
further damages. Must Mira obtain Sally’s informed consent before she
can agree to represent Jose?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Yes, because Jose’s interests are directly adverse to
Sally’s.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because there is a significant risk that Mira’s
representation of Jose will be materially limited by her loyalty to
Sally.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because Jose’s lawsuit is not substantially related to the
breach of contract lawsuit against Rome’s Own, Inc.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because Jose’s interests are not materially adverse to
Sally’s.</p></li>

<h3>Question 2.3</h3>
<p>Use the facts from the previous question. Must Mira obtain Jose’s
informed consent before she can agree to represent Jose?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Yes, because Jose’s interests are directly adverse to
Sally’s.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because there is a significant risk that Mira’s
representation of Jose will be materially limited by her loyalty to
Sally.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because Jose’s lawsuit is not substantially related to the
breach of contract lawsuit against Rome’s Own, Inc.</p></li>

<h3>Question 2.4</h3>
<p>Lawyer Shawn has handled various property and business transactions
for Evelyn, her adult daughter Adelaide, and Evelyn’s business partner,
Oliver, during the last decade. Those matters are all completed. Five
years ago, Shawn wrote a will for Evelyn in which she left all of her
property to Adelaide. In that work, Shawn represented and gave advice to
both Evelyn and Adelaide. Adelaide, who lives with her mother, suffers
from disabling epilepsy and has not been able to support herself. After
Shawn finished drafting the will, he drafted a letter to Evelyn and
Adelaide informing them that his office was closing their file and
confirming the termination of their lawyer-client relationship. However,
he failed to mail them the letter.</p>
<p>Last week, Evelyn came to Shawn to tell him that it’s time for
Adelaide to stand on her own two feet. She mentioned that Adelaide has
become involved with a boyfriend, Felix, and has been staying out
nights. She would like Shawn to write a new will for her in which she
would leave all of her property to Oliver. She further asks Shawn not to
reveal to Adelaide the contents of the new will.</p>
<p>May Shawn write the new will for Evelyn?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Yes, because his prior representation of Adelaide was incidental
to his representation of Evelyn.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because he will not reveal the contents of the new will to
Adelaide without authorization by Evelyn.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because he failed to inform Adelaide that he no longer
represents her.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because he did not obtain Adelaide’s informed consent to his
representation of Evelyn with respect to the new will.</p></li>

<h3>Question 2.5</h3>
<p>Kieran, five years out of law school, accepted a job with Sato &amp;
Perlmutter, LLP. A couple of months after he started work, Miranda
Perlmutter was asked to take over representation of Kasho Natural Foods
in an ongoing lawsuit against the Roxbury Box Company. Kasho had fired
its previous counsel after a dispute over legal fees. Miranda wants to
accept Kasho as a client. However, there may be a problem.</p>
<p>Kieran came to Sato &amp; Perlmutter from another firm, Podkrash and
Associates, LLP, where he had worked for three years. The Podkrash firm
has been representing the Roxbury Box Company in the Kasho litigation
for the last two years. Kieran did not work on the Roxbury matter while
he worked at Podkrash. While Kieran was working at Podkrash, he dated
Lance, the senior paralegal at the firm. Lance oversaw all the staff
work on the Roxbury matter and talked at length about the factual and
strategic issues in the case with Kieran on many occasions. For example,
the two men talked about a decision of the partner in charge of the
litigation that a key document that might impact Roxbury’s liability was
not covered by the plaintiffs’ discovery request. Lance disagreed with
the partner’s decision, but ultimately decided to keep his mouth
shut.</p>
<p>After consultation with her firm’s ethics counsel, Miranda decides to
undertake representation of Kasho. However, she does not wish to
terminate Kieran’s employment as a way to solve any conflicts problem.
Instead, she timely screens Kieran from the lawyers working on the
matter, sees to it that he receives no part of the fee from the Kasho
matter, and provides appropriate written notices to Roxbury about the
screening procedures.</p>
<p>Was Sato &amp; Perlmutter permitted to undertake representation of
Kasho in this manner?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Yes, because Lance and Kieran’s relationship was personal in
nature.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because Kieran was properly screened from the Kasho
representation.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because there is a substantial risk that confidential
information that Kieran would have learned at the Podkrash firm would
materially advance Kasho’s position in the litigation.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because this is a situation in which screening is
insufficient to avoid the possibility of a conflict of interest so long
as Kieran remains at the firm.</p></li>

<h3>Question 2.6</h3>
<p>Five years ago, attorney Barry worked at a large law firm with
offices across the country. One of the firm’s partners defended Panko,
Inc., an appliance manufacturer, against allegations that its toasters
had a defect that would cause many of them to catch fire. Barry was not
involved in that litigation and did not learn anything about it during
his time at the firm. Barry has since opened up a private practice of
his own. Ted comes to Barry’s new office seeking legal help. Ted tells
Barry that his Panko toaster recently overheated and caused a house
fire. He would like to sue Panko for damages. May Barry represent him a
suit against Panko without Panko’s informed consent?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Yes, because there was not a substantial risk that confidential
factual information as would normally have been obtained in the prior
representation of Panko would materially advance Ted’s position in the
subsequent matter.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because Barry did not actually acquire confidential
information that is material to Ted’s lawsuit while he was working at
his old law firm.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because the matters are the same or substantially
related.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because Ted’s interests are materially adverse to those of
Panko.</p></li>

<h3>Question 2.7</h3>
<p>Armand, a lawyer, represented Walter, a plastic surgeon, during
Walter’s contested divorce from his wife five years ago. Armand no
longer has any contact with Walter, and he does not remember anything
about Walter’s case. Recently, one of Walter’s patients, Celia,
developed serious complications and nearly died as the result of the
extensive cosmetic surgery that Walter performed on her. She wants to
sue him for punitive damages based on gross negligence. She has asked
Armand to represent her. May he do so without Walter’s consent?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Yes, because he no longer represents Walter and the medical
malpractice matter is unrelated to the divorce.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because he does not remember anything about Walter’s
case.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because a lawyer may not sue a former client without the
former client’s consent.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because Armand would normally have obtained information in
the divorce case that could be helpful to Celia.</p></li>

<h3>Question 2.8</h3>
<p>Attorney Ash is a solo practitioner specializing in serving small
businesses. Ten years ago, Ash handled a routine health department
license application for Sprinkles, a newly founded small family-owned
bakery. Sprinkles is now known for its cupcakes. Death by Cupcake (DBC)
is a bakery across town from Sprinkles that also specializes in
cupcakes. DBC would like to hire Ash to represent them in negotiating a
commercial lease to open a new bakery. As it happens, the property it
wants to lease is across across the street from Sprinkles. The increased
competition would significantly hurt Sprinkles’ business. May Ash accept
the representation without obtaining Sprinkles’ informed consent?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Yes, because informed consent is not required when a prospective
client and a former client are merely economic competitors.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because the two matters are not substantially
related.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because DBC and Sprinkles are economic competitors.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because DBC’s interests are materially adverse to
Sprinkles’.</p></li>

<p>Attorney Darla represents the plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit

The plaintiffs allege that Nutrisnax falsely advertised its granola bars
as a healthy alternative to candy bars when, in fact, the granola bars
contained just as much fat, sugar, and sodium as the average candy bar.
The class includes anyone who purchased a Nutrisnax granola bar in the
last three years. Last week, a potential client named Samuel came into
Darla’s office and asked her to represent him in his claim for child
support against his former husband, Franklin. Darla learned that
Franklin purchased hundreds of Nutrisnax granola bars during the
relevant period, making him one of the unnamed members of the class in
the granola bar suit. Must Darla obtain Franklin’s informed consent
before agreeing to represent Samuel?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Yes, because Samuel’s interests are directly adverse to
Franklin’s.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because Darla cannot reasonably believe that she can
competently and diligently represent both Franklin and Samuel.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because the child support claim is unrelated to the class
action lawsuit.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because unnamed members of a class are ordinarily not
considered to be clients of the lawyer for conflicts purposes.</p></li>

<h3>Question 3.2</h3>
<p>Chris and Bobby are accused of burglarizing a house. They want Meyer
to represent both of them in the criminal matter because they prefer not
to have to pay two lawyers. Also, they believe that if they coordinate
their stories and refuse to cooperate with the police, the state won’t
have enough evidence to convict either of them. No state statute
prohibits lawyers from representing criminal co-defendants. Meyer
obtains the police reports and charging documents. He also obtains the
criminal records of both Chris and Bobby. From his investigation, Meyer
learns that Chris may have been the instigator. Chris is 26 years old
and Bobby is 19. Chris has three prior felony convictions, while Bobby
has a prior conviction for possession of a small amount of marijuana,
for which he received a suspended sentence that could be revoked if he
is again convicted. Meyer’s law clerk recommends that Meyer obtain a
court order permitting the joint representation, but Meyer declines to
seek such an order because he believes that he can provide competent and
diligent representation to both defendants. May Meyer represent both
defendants if each gives informed consent to the joint representation,
confirmed in writing?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Yes, because both clients have provided consent confirmed in
writing.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because the charges arise out of a single incident.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because Meyer did not seek an order from the judge allowing
the joint representation.</p></li>

conflict.</p></li>

<h3>Question 3.3</h3>
<p>Larry, the father of Linda, Abby, and Carl, died at age 87. His
property was to be divided equally among his children. Louise, Larry’s
partner, is executor of the estate. Most of his property is in cash and
stocks, but Larry also left his children a lakeside cabin. The three
adult children decide that Carl should take the cabin and should pay his
sisters one-third of its value each out of his share of the cash and
stocks. The appraised value of the cabin is $225,000, but Carl urges
that, for the purpose of the transfer, the cabin should be valued at
$150,000, because he believes the appraised value is unrealistic and
that he will soon have to replace the water and septic systems for the
cabin, at considerable cost. After some discussion, Linda and Abby are
willing to go along with their brother’s suggestion as to the valuation
of the cabin because they care more about their brother than they do
about the money. The three siblings need to hire legal assistance to
prepare and file the documents relating to the transfer of the cabin.
Carl proposes that they hire Morton, a lawyer he has used for other
legal matters over the last ten years. Morton reasonably believes that
he could competently represent all three siblings. He explains the
potential problems and the advantages and risks of joint representation
and obtains their consent to the joint representation. None of the
siblings has any questions or new proposals, and he does not provide any
legal advice to them. Morton then prepares a document valuing the cabin
at $150,000 for purposes of the transfer, just as the siblings agreed.
Each sibling confirms that all of them still want him to be their
attorney. May he represent all three siblings in the transaction?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Yes, because Morton merely prepared documents per their joint
instructions, so he did not even need their informed consent.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because there is no apparent conflict between the interests
of the three siblings and he obtained their informed consent.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because Carl would benefit by the cabin being assigned a
lesser value, while Abby and Linda would be paid more if the assigned
value is higher, so the conflict is non-consentable.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because Morton’s prior representation of Carl creates a
significant risk that his representation of Linda and Abby would be
materially limited by his felt loyalty to Carl.</p></li>

<section id="question-3.4" class="level3">
<h3>Question 3.4</h3>
<p>In answering this question, use the facts of the previous question
and assume that Morton has properly undertaken the representation of the
three siblings.</p>
<p>In the course of his research before preparing the property transfer
documents for Larry’s summer cabin, Morton discovers that Carl could
obtain a reduction in tax liability for the cabin if the transfer of the
cabin is postponed until next year. Morton knows that Linda and Abby are
eager to conclude the transaction and that they will be able to earn
more interest on funds paid to them by Carl if the payment is made this
year instead of next year. Carl asks Morton whether he could postpone
the transfer of the cabin until next year, slowing things down without
revealing any reasons for the delay.</p>
<p>May Morton delay the transaction without disclosing the reasons to
Carl’s sisters?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Yes, because the adverse consequence to them from the delay will
not be as significant as the resulting benefit to Carl.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because this will allow him to avoid the clients’
potentially adverse interests and to focus on their common
interests.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because each client is entitled to be told information
relating to the representation that might affect the client’s
interests.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because Carl’s suggestion would involve Morton in a fraud
against Linda and Abby, requiring Morton’s immediate withdrawal from
representation of Carl.</p></li>

<h3>Question 3.5</h3>
<p>Jaiden, an assistant general counsel of Plenum, Inc., a
pharmaceutical manufacturer, was asked to investigate whether the
research division of Plenum was concealing reports of adverse reactions
to the company’s best-selling product, Somalox, an anti-depressant. Two
users of Somalox had contacted the general counsel’s office, reporting
that they had submitted adverse reaction reports to the research
division, as directed on the package insert, but that they had received
no response from the company. One of these two users alleged that he had
suffered hallucinations and suicidal ideation after taking Somalox, and
that he had described these reactions in his earlier report. The other
user reported that she was hospitalized for depression after having
taken Somalox for several weeks. She also had reported this to the
research division. The non-response is worrisome. The company policy is
to acknowledge receipt of any adverse reaction reports and to assure
users that the company will report adverse reactions to the Food and
Drug Administration as required by law. The research division would
route any adverse reaction reports through the general counsel’s office
to the FDA, but none have been received or sent for Somalox.</p>
<p>Jaiden schedules a meeting with Bertha, the chief of the research
division. Jaiden shows her the correspondence sent to the general
counsel’s office by the two users and asks her to show him these and any
other adverse reaction reports that the company has received. Bertha
flushes and stammers in response to Jaiden’s query. “I am afraid that I
have let a few of these slip through the cracks. Since you are the
company’s lawyer, I can speak to you in confidence, right? Am I in
trouble here?”</p>
<p>In answering Bertha’s questions, which of the following statements
would Jaiden be best advised to make?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>“Our conversation is protected by attorney-client privilege, so
you can talk with me in confidence.”</p></li>
<li><p>“You can speak to me in confidence, because you are an employee
of Plenum, and therefore your interests are aligned with those of the
company.”</p></li>
<li><p>“I represent Plenum, so I cannot give you any legal advice except
the advice to get a lawyer.”</p></li>
<li><p>“I have to report anything that you tell me to the company’s
leadership, because I represent the company, but I can assure you that
the information won’t be shared outside of the company—for example, with
law enforcement agencies.”</p></li>

<p>Lucille, a criminal defense lawyer, receives a frantic call from
Sylvia, who states that her sister, Basia, who recently immigrated from
Poland, has been arrested by state police for a drug violation, and that
the bail hearing will be held in less than two hours. She asks Lucille
to represent Basia at the bail hearing and in her criminal case. Lucille
hires Magda, a Polish-speaking interpreter, and rushes to the
courthouse, where she is able to briefly meet with Basia and represent
her at the bail hearing. The judge sets the bail at $2,000. Sylvia is
able to pay the bail amount, and Basia is released from prison that
night. The next day, Lucille meets with Basia, with Magda interpreting,
and informs her that her rate for legal services is $300 per hour. She
states that that rate will be used to calculate the bill for the work
that Lucille did on the bail hearing, and for future work that she will
do on the criminal case. Basia agrees to the rate and Lucille begins
work on her case. There is no other discussion of how much Basia will
have to pay. At Basia’s hearing five months later, the arresting officer
fails to appear, and the charges against Basia are dropped. The next
month, Lucille sends Basia a bill for $1,800, including five hours of
her work, plus $300 for Magda’s services. Is Lucille subject to

agrees to the fee arrangement. Spencer contacts the ski slope’s insurer,
and within three weeks, with Craig’s approval, the case is settled for
$21,000. Spencer transmits $14,000 of that settlement to Craig. Spencer
spent only four hours on the case. Was Spencer’s conduct proper?</p>

the exam, and was admitted to the bar in state A) He maintains active
membership even though he is neither practicing law, nor living in state
A) Milan bought a small computer consulting firm in neighboring state B

actually was. After a few months of operating the business, the buyer
sued Milan for damages for fraud and to rescind the contract. That
lawsuit is pending. Is Milan subject to discipline in state A?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Yes, because Milan lied to the buyer about the value of the
business, even though his dishonesty took place in state B.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because the terms of the agreement (including the value of
the business) were not fair and fully disclosed to the buyer, as
required by Rule 1.8(a), nor did the buyer give informed
consent.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because Milan was not practicing law and this deal was not
related to law practice.</p></li>

<h3>Question 4.17</h3>
<p>Danielle is a lawyer. Ted, the son of her brother Matthew, is very
ill with a life-threatening condition. Ted must get a certain medication
that costs $1,400 in the next 24 hours or else he will go into kidney
failure. Matthew has no cash, but he will receive a large sum from the
sale of his home in one week. Matthew has no other possible source of
funds until then unless Danielle gives him a short-term loan. Danielle
is flat broke (in fact, she is deeply in debt), but there is $120,000 in
Danielle’s trust account. This amount is the proceeds of a personal
injury settlement that Danielle will distribute to her client Van. She
represented him on a pro bono basis, so she is not owed a fee from the
settlement. Van is in prison for the next few years. Danielle has agreed
to hold the funds for Van in the interim and to make mortgage payments
on his house as they become due. Danielle lends Matthew $1,400 from this
account for Ted’s medication. She is unable to ask for Van’s approval
because he is in solitary confinement because he talked back to a prison
guard and is not allowed to receive phone calls. Danielle, confident
that Van would approve, sends him a letter explaining her intention to
make the loan to her brother. A week later, Matthew receives the
proceeds from the sale of his house. He repays Danielle, who replenishes
the client trust account. Van later writes Danielle that he is glad that
she was able to make the loan to her brother. There is no resulting
delay in the distribution of the settlement funds to Van or in the
making of mortgage payments. Is Danielle subject to discipline?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Yes, even though she promptly informed Van that she borrowed the
money and he ratified her prior action.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because she promptly informed Van that she loaned out a chunk
of his money and he ratified her prior action.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because there was no delay either in making the payments on
Van’s mortgage or in the distribution of the settlement funds to
Van.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because she did this to prevent reasonably certain death or
substantial bodily harm to a child.</p></li>

<h3>Question 5.2</h3>
<p>Abdul, a lawyer, is employed by the United States Department of Labor
and works in its Office of Civil Rights. He is also an experienced
litigator. His neighbor, Blaine, has been having a dispute with the
Internal Revenue Service, which claims that Blaine’s deduction for home
office expenses is not valid and has withheld part of his claimed tax
refund. Abdul wants to represent Blaine in a suit against the United
States in the federal Tax Court to try to obtain the withheld portion of
Blaine’s refund. He would not charge Blaine any fee. Also, Abdul has
spoken to his supervisor in the Department of Labor, who has confirmed
that the Department would have no objection to Abdul providing legal
assistance to Blaine in his dispute with the Internal Revenue Service
and will confirm this in writing. As a result, Abdul is confident that
there is no conflict of interest, and he does not intend to advise
Blaine that he should get a different lawyer, because any other lawyer
would charge a substantial fee to Blaine. May Abdul represent Blaine in
this litigation?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Yes, because he is not going to charge a fee.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because he is obtaining written approval from the Department
of Labor.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because he does not plan to advise Blaine about the
possibility of obtaining a different lawyer.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because a federal employee may not represent an unrelated
client in a claim against the United States.</p></li>

<h3>Question 5.3</h3>
<p>After she graduated from law school, Dania worked for the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) for three years. During that time, she
worked on securing an indictment in a large securities case involving
seven defendants who collaborated on an insider trading scheme. At the
end of three years, she moved on to a position at one office of a large
private law firm whose practice includes defense of securities fraud
cases. A month after she started work at the firm, Dania learned that a
partner in the firm was representing one of the defendants in the
securities case that Dania had worked on while she was at the SEC) This
did not emerge in the preliminary conflicts screening before she was
hired because Dania’s work focused on three of the other defendants in
the suit. The basic facts were the same, but the targets were different.
What should the firm do to enable it to represent the defendant in the
securities fraud case?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Instruct Dania not to reveal to anyone in the law firm anything
she learned about the case while she was at the SEC.</p></li>
<li><p>Screen Dania from any participation in the matter, prevent her
from receiving any extra pay related to the matter, and give written
notice of the potential conflict to the SEC.</p></li>
<li><p>Transfer Dania, while the litigation is pending, to a different
office of the firm, in another city.</p></li>
<li><p>Discharge Dania, because that is the only way in which the firm
could both comply with the ethics rules and continue to represent its
client.</p></li>

<h3>Question 5.5</h3>
<p>In a state in which judges are elected, Damian Garner, the President
of Garner Industries, a manufacturer of firearms, has donated $3,000 to
the successful campaign of Ambrose Zoltan, who was elected as a judge of
the state’s highest court. That contribution represented 2 percent of
the campaign contributions that the judge received. All contributions
were disclosed pursuant to the state’s campaign finance disclosure
law.</p>
<p>A gun control group sued Garner Industries for violating the state’s
gun control laws by manufacturing and selling guns with built-in
silencers. The court ruled against Garner and it has appealed to the
state supreme court, arguing that the gun control law is inconsistent
with the Second Amendment. The gun control group filed a motion asking
Judge Zoltan to recuse himself, but he denied the motion. Would Judge
Zoltan’s participation in the adjudication of this case be
unconstitutional?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Yes, because Garner made a substantial contribution to his
campaign.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because not all parties have consented to his
participation.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because the contribution was only a small part of his
campaign treasury.</p></li>

<h3>Question 5.6</h3>
<p>Evelyn, a recently admitted attorney, is serving as a law clerk to
Judge Leopold Osterman on the state court of appeals. The judge has
heard the appeal in a contract dispute in which IGL Corp. has sued
Mountain Hardware, Inc., for damages. Mountain Hardware was represented
by the law firm of Westerfield &amp; Pilson, which Evelyn worked for
during her second summer in law school. She did not work on that dispute
while she was at the firm, because the firm accepted it after she left
the job, but Judge Osterman has asked her to write the opinion in the
case. While she was working on the opinion, Margaret Pilson from
Westerfield &amp; Pilson emailed Evelyn, on her private email account,
asking whether she would like to discuss joining the firm as an
associate after she finished her clerkship. Evelyn wanted to take that
job, so she told Judge Osterman about the email, and he said that it was
fine to discuss a possible job with the firm. Evelyn and the firm then
agreed on a starting salary of $95,000, and that she would begin work
two weeks after her clerkship ended. A week later, Evelyn completed the
opinion, which the judge adopted. It dismissed the case against Mountain
Hardware. Is Evelyn subject to discipline?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Yes, because she entered into negotiations and a future
employment agreement with a firm while participating personally and
substantially as a judicial law clerk writing an opinion that would
affect a present client of that firm.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because her opinion favored the firm that was offering her a
job.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because she notified her employer of the overture from the
law firm and her intent to pursue it.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because she did not submit the opinion to the judge until
after she had accepted the firm’s offer, so she could not have been
helping a client of the firm in order to procure a job offer.</p></li>

<h3>Question 5.7</h3>
<p>Erin, a lawyer, had a motion that was scheduled to be argued on
November 5. Another attorney, Manfred, represented her adversary. On
October 31, Erin learned that her son’s surgery had been scheduled for
November 5, and she wanted to be with her son on the day of the surgery.
She tried to call Manfred to discuss rescheduling, but he was out of
town and could not be reached that day. So without first notifying
Manfred, she telephoned the judge’s clerk to find out whether the
argument on the motion could be heard the following week. To her
surprise, the judge picked up the phone and explained that he had
answered because his clerk was at lunch. Erin explained the situation
and asked the judge whether the argument could be scheduled for November
12. The judge checked his computer and advised that he could fit in the
argument on that date, and he advised Erin to notify Manfred of her
request and if Manfred had no objection, to telephone his clerk in a few
hours. He said that his clerk would also send a notice to her and to
Manfred, describing his conversation with Erin and notifying that in the
absence of any objection, the hearing would be rescheduled as requested.
Is Erin subject to discipline?</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Yes, because she didn’t notify Manfred that she was going to
telephone the judge’s chambers about rescheduling the hearing.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, because she spoke directly to the judge rather than to his
clerk.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because it was not her fault that the judge picked up the
telephone.</p></li>
<li><p>No, because she only discussed a procedural issue with the
judge.</p></li>
