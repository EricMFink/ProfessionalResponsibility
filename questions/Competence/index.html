<section id="question-1" class="level3">
<h3>Question 1</h3>
<p>Lawyer represents ABC Corp. ABC has a very good breach of contract
action against one of its regular customers, XYZ Corp. ABC hires Lawyer
to sue XYZ. Lawyer advises ABC’s president that, “although you have a
great lawsuit and I’m prepared to file the complaint, I do not think it
is a wise business decision for you to sue a regular customer?”</p>
<p>Did Lawyer act properly?</p>
</section>
<section id="question-2" class="level3">
<h3>Question 2</h3>
<p>Lawyer represents A in a child custody dispute. A is the custodial
parent of three children. A’s former spouse, B, has filed the child
custody suit in an attempt to obtain custody of the children. A is a
heavy drinker and has had considerable difficulty raising the children.
Lawyer advises A: “I think you should seek treatment for your drinking
and attend some parenting classes.”</p>
<p>Did Lawyer act properly?</p>
</section>
<section id="question-3" class="level3">
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<p>Lawyer, a partner in the Smith Law Firm, represents ABC Corp. in tax
matters. ABC works with other companies (“customers”) to reduce their
income tax exposure. ABC has created a new type of transaction which
purportedly has significant tax advantages. ABC would like to market
this new transaction to its customers. In order to make the new
transaction more appealing to customers, ABC has asked Lawyer to prepare
an opinion letter in which Lawyer opines on the tax advantages. ABC will
give this opinion letter to customers and potential customers.</p>
<ul>
<li>May Lawyer prepare the opinion letter?</li>
<li>What should Lawyer do if she disagrees with ABC as to the tax
advantages of the new transaction?</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="question-4" class="level3">
<h3>Question 4</h3>
<p>Anderson is an associate with the law firm of Peterson &amp; Paulson.
Peterson &amp; Paulson are the only partners in the firm. Company hired
Peterson to sue Competitor, who was selling products with similar names
and packaging to Company’s products. Peterson assigned Anderson to
research the applicable law and draft a complaint. Anderson researched
state law, but did not also research federal law. Based on that
research, Anderson drafted a complaint asserting only a claim for unfair
and deceptive trade practices under state law, which requires proof of
intent to deceive. A reasonably competent lawyer would have also
identified a potentially stronger claim under federal law, which does
not require proof of intent. Peterson filed the complaint as drafted by
Anderson, and served as the sole trial counsel. Paulson had no
involvement in the case. Following a bench trial, the judge rendered a
verdict in favor of Competitor, on the grounds that the evidence
presented was insufficient to establish intent. Based on the same
evidence presented at trial, Company would have prevailed on the federal
claim.</p>
<p>Which of the lawyers, if any, may be subject to discipline for breach
of the duty of competence under MRPC Rule 1.1?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Anderson only</p></li>
<li><p>Anderson and Peterson, but not Paulson</p></li>
<li><p>Anderson, Peterson, &amp; Paulson.</p></li>
<li><p>None.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="question-5" class="level3">
<h3>Question 5</h3>
<p>Same facts as the previous question. Which of the lawyers, if any,
may be liable to Company for malpractice?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Anderson only</p></li>
<li><p>Anderson and Peterson, but not Paulson</p></li>
<li><p>Anderson, Peterson, &amp; Paulson.</p></li>
<li><p>None.</p></li>
</ol>

<section id="question-6" class="level3">
<h3>Question 6</h3>
<p>For many years Attorney has done all of the routine business law work
for Corporation. Now Corporation has asked Attorney to represent it in
negotiating a contract to supply electronic components to the federal
government. Attorney knows nothing about government contract law except
that it is a highly specialized field governed by a mass of technical
regulations. For which of the following would Attorney be subject to
discipline under the MRPC?</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Declining to represent Corporation, and to charge Carmondy a
nominal fee for finding Carmondy a lawyer who specializes in government
contract law.</p></li>
<li><p>Agreeing to represent Corporation, provided Corporation consents
to the association of a lawyer with experience in government contract
law.</p></li>
<li><p>Agreeing to represent Corporation, and then subcontracting the
legal work to a lawyer with experience in government contract
law.</p></li>
<li><p>Agreeing to represent Corporation, intending to master the field
of government contract law with reasonable speed and
efficiency.</p></li>
</ol>

<section id="question-7" class="level3">
<h3>Question 7</h3>
<p>Client was injured when a physician’s assistant improperly treated
Client when he was in the hospital for a heart condition. Client
consulted with Lawyer about suing the hospital. Lawyer never had handled
a medical malpractice case previously, but was confident in her
abilities because she had experience in plaintiff’s work and in trying
civil cases, and planned to educate herself about medical malpractice
claims. Accordingly, Lawyer accepted the representation. The case
ultimately went to trial, and Lawyer lost the case. Client sued Lawyer
for malpractice. Which of the following circumstances likely would
demonstrate Lawyer’s breach of her duty of competence to Client? Select
all that apply:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Lawyer accepting a medical malpractice for the first
time.</p></li>
<li><p>Lawyer decided to call only one of expert medical witnesses with
whom she had consulted as trial witnesses, when Client believed that the
jury would be more impressed if Lawyer called multiple experts.</p></li>
<li><p>Lawyer did not investigate whether any other staff at the
hospital witnessed the alleged improper treatment of Client.</p></li>
<li><p>Lawyer did not discover a published regulation governing required
staff-to-patient ratios at the hospital.</p></li>
<li><p>Lawyer did not consult with an available expert about
staff-patient ratios necessary to ensure reasonably safe medical
treatment. .</p></li>
