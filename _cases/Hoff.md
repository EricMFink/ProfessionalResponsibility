On August 16, 2000, William Bruce Hoff, Jr. (Hoff), and Catherine Hoff, his wife, filed a complaint for declaratory judgment and other relief in the circuit court of Cook County against Mayer, Brown & Platt (MBP), a Chicago law firm. Thereafter, MBP filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff's complaint. On June 12, 2001, the trial court granted defendant's motion. Hoff now appeals.

Hoff argues on appeal: (1) that the retirement provision in MBP's restated plan is a restrictive covenant and is contrary to Illinois public policy; (2) that the provision is unreasonably broad; and (3) that under any circumstance, Hoff is entitled to a trial on the issues of whether he has materially competed with MBP and whether MBP can reasonably refuse to determine that any alleged damage caused by Hoff has ended.

According to the complaint, Hoff resigned as a partner with MBP on July 9, 1993. At the time of his resignation, Hoff was 60 years old and had been with MBP for 36 years. Hoff requested retirement income from MBP. MBP has refused to pay Hoff retirement income based on its "Restated Partnership Agreement, Retirement, Disability & Death Benefit Program" (Restated Plan or Plan). In his complaint, Hoff alleges that he should have been receiving in excess of $94,000 per year in retirement income, plus additional cost-of-living adjustments, pursuant to the Plan, since his resignation in 1993. From the record below, there is no dispute that Hoff left MBP to become a founding partner in another Chicago firmâ€”Kasowitz, Hoff, Benson & Torres. Additionally, Hoff received all earned fee income, capital shares, financial benefits and other revenue to which he was entitled, based on his association with MBP and his years of service to the firm. He disputes only MBP's decision to deny him retirement benefits.

The dispute here centers around sections 3.1 and 3.2 of MBP's Restated Plan, and Rule 5.6 of the Illinois Rules of Professional Conduct. MBP's Restated Plan states:

> 3.1 _In General_. If a member's membership in the firm is terminated by reason of his or her retirement on a retirement date (as described in subsection 3.2) on or after January 1, 1987, he or she will be provided with a retirement income in an amount determined in accordance with the provisions of subsection 3.3.

> 3.2 _Retirement Date_. The 'retirement date' for a member is the one of the following dates that applies in his or her case:

> (a) _Normal Retirement Date_. The 'normal retirement date' for a member shall be the first day of the calendar month as of which he or she elects to retire or is retired by the firm, provided in either event that, as of such day, he or she shall have also either (i) attained at least 65 years of age or (ii) attained at least 62, but not yet attained 65, years of age and completed at least 20 years' associated with the firm.

> (b) _Early Retirement Date_. The 'early retirement date' for a member shall be the first day of the calendar month as of which he or she elects to retire or is retired by the firm, provided in either event that, as of such day, he or she shall have also attained at least 60, but not yet 62, years of age and completed at least 20 years' associated with the firm.

> For purposes of this program, a member shall not be deemed to have elected to retire prior to attaining age 65 unless he or she substantially ceases the active practice of law on a permanent basis or his or her post-retirement practice of law is determined by the firm to be consistent with his or her status as a retiree.

Rule 5.6(a) of the Illinois Rules of Professional Conduct, entitled "Restrictions on Right to Practice," provides: "A lawyer shall not participate in offering or making: (a) a partnership or employment agreement that restricts the rights of a lawyer to practice after termination of the relationship, except an agreement concerning benefits upon retirement\* \* \*." 

Hoff first claims that MBP's Restated Plan is basically a restrictive covenant and is contrary to Illinois public policy. Hoff argues that whether MBP's Plan comports with Rule 5.6(a) depends on whether the "benefits" under the Plan constitute "retirement benefits" under Rule 5.6(a).

Hoff correctly points out in his brief that under Rule 5.6(a), a lawyer may not participate in an agreement that "restricts the rights of a lawyer to practice" after a relationship between the lawyer and firm has ended. 134 Ill.2d R. 5.6(a). Illinois public policy has consistently discouraged law firm employment agreements that contain noncompetition clauses or restrictive covenants. Historically, these provisions have been strictly scrutinized by the courts as they can result in restraints on trade. "The rule is designed both to afford clients greater freedom in choosing counsel and to protect lawyers from onerous conditions that would unduly limit their mobility." Noncompetition clauses are especially discouraged in the legal profession where the lawyer is not selling or promoting a commodity but rather his or her personal service. Rule 5.6 was also designed to protect lawyers and clients from "illegitimate anti-competitive practices that will distort the market and ultimately drive up the price of legal services." 

Rule 5.6(a), however, provides for an exception to the rule that noncompetition provisions are generally unenforceable. The rule states that an agreement concerning benefits upon retirement is exempt from the general rule. It has been noted that "[t]he purpose and meaning of the exception for 'benefits upon retirement' \* \* \* is not crystal clear." The Annotated Model Rules of Professional Conduct interprets the retirement benefits exception to mean that

> "when a lawyer is retiring or winding up his or her affairs with a firm, the lawyer's receipt of full retirement benefits entails an assumption that he or she is truly retiring from practice. This further suggests that the lawyer may be required to agree to 'stay retired' as a condition of the settlement." 

We find this interpretation instructive.

[ * * * ]

We recognize the concern that law firms may unfairly take advantage of the exception in Rule 5.6(a). [T]he Annotated Model Rules of Professional Conduct opines: "in cases when a law firm attempts to categorize a lawyer's departure from the firm as a 'retirement' for purposes of restricting his or her subsequent right to practice law, the courts have rejected such retirement provisions." Annotated Model Rules of Professional Conduct 467 (4th ed.1999). Here, we do not find MBP's plan characterized Hoff's departure from the firm as a retirement for purposes of restricting his right to practice law. Rather, "retirement" has been defined under the plan for purposes of receiving future benefits. As noted in the model rules, law firms are restricted from using "retirement" for other such purposes. Here, Hoff was 60 years old and had been with MBP for 36 years when he made the decision to resign from the firm and begin a new partnership, and MBP provided Hoff with all fees and benefits due and owing to him at the time of his resignation. MBP denied Hoff only future benefits under the firm's retirement provision. In interpreting the exception to Rule 5.6, the annotated rules explain that receipt of retirement benefits would "entail[ ] an assumption that [a lawyer] is truly retiring from practice \* \* \* [and] that a lawyer may be required to agree to 'stay retired' as a condition of the settlement." 

The Connecticut Supreme Court addressed the issue of postemployment benefits in _Schoonmaker v. Cummings & Lockwood of Connecticut, P.C._. In that case, Schoonmaker, a former partner with the defendant law firm, argued that his former firm's decision to withhold compensation upon his departure from the firm and decision to compete was a violation of the public policy embedded in Rule 5.6. The court held that while it agreed that public policy favors a client's access to an attorney of choice:

> "It would be illogical to expect law firms to pay out large sums of cash to departing lawyers while fearing that their cash flow will be threatened by competing lawyers and the loss of potential clients. Implicit in the retirement benefits exception, therefore, is the notion that the public's interest in fostering liberal competition among practitioners must be balanced against a law firm's interest in maintaining a steady income flow for the purpose of providing former members with substantial remuneration upon retirement." 

In the instant case, we find, reading and interpreting MBP's Restated Plan regarding retirement benefits in light of Rule 5.6(a), the proper balance between the public's interest in choice and a law firm's interest in maintaining income. Keeping in mind the public policy embodied in Rule 5.6, we cannot say that MBP violated this policy by denying Hoff retirement benefits. Hoff relinquished retirement benefits from MBP by resigning from the firm and continuing to practice law.

Hoff next argues that the provision in MBP's Restated Plan is unreasonably broad. He argues that the noncompetition provision in the Plan is overbroad in that it is worldwide in its application, is universal in both the nature of the law practice it prohibits and the clients to which it applies, and is unlimited in time. Hoff. contends that even assuming the general enforceability of the provision in light of the retirement benefits exception, the provision must still meet a "reasonableness requirement."

[ * * * ]

In his brief, Hoff states that the "discretion provided to [MBP] in the Restated Plan, in effect, gives the firm the power to control a withdrawing partner's practice of law and the clients' right to choose counsel in violation of the public policy underlying Rule 5.6(a)." We find this to be a vast overstatement. MBP's Plan, in relevant part, states that in the event a partner retires from the firm and chooses to continue to practice law, he or she will be denied retirement benefits. A former partner is free to practice law and clients are not restricted in their choice of counsel. The Plan gives the retiring partner the choice between continuing to practice law and receiving retirement benefits. Because this provision is adequately protected by Rule 5.6(a), we find it does not require restrictive language addressing time, place or scope of future practice. The cases that have specifically addressed the issues of time, place and scope are cases that interpret noncompetition provisions, not provisions addressing retirement benefits.We find that the retirement provision in MBP's Restated Plan is not unreasonably broad.
