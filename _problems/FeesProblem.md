Your law office is a small firm of private practice lawyers. The prospective client, Dave Defendant, consulted with your office about representing him to defend against a personal injury lawsuit filed against him and his liquor store business. The plaintiff alleges he was severely injured in a slip-and-fall inside the store. The plaintiff claims $1.5 million in damages. Dave’s insurance policy coverage is limited to $750,000 for a single incident. Dave’s business is very profitable, but it also remains leveraged with start-up business loan debt, so Dave is quite worried about any judgment that exceeds his insurance policy coverage. Dave also has evidence that his staff maintained the store carefully, and Dave told you during the consultation that he believes the plaintiff’s own carelessness must have caused or contributed to the accident.

At the close of your consultation with Dave, he indicated he wishes to retain your firm. Dave is receptive to a reasonable settlement, but will fight the case if necessary, especially to limit the judgment to his insurance policy.

- Dave does not want to pay your firm by the hour, and proposed a flat fee of $7,500 to handle the matter.

- You will agree to this flat fee as the fee for pre-trial negotiations and litigation. You also advised Dave that he will need to advance $2,500 in expenses to fund pre-trial costs. The flat fee and initial expenses, however, will not cover the costs of an actual trial. You proposed a contingent fee in the form of a “value fee” if the case goes to trial.

- Dave agreed to this additional contingent trial fee, if he can be sure that the amount reasonably will reflect savings achieved by your firm.

Draft a retainer agreement that that you will ask Dave to sign that addresses the following issues in compliance with Model Rules 1.5 and 1.15: 

1. An agreement to the $7,500 flat fee, paid in advance under Model Rule 1.5(b); 

2. A “value” contingent fee agreement to cover a trial under Model Rules 1.5(a) and 1.5(c); 

3. An agreement regarding expenses under Model Rules 1.5(b) and 1.5(c); and (4) a statement of the proper law firm account into which your office will place the flat fee and expenses under Model Rule 1.15.
