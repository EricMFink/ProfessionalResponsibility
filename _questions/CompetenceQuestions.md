### Question 3

Lawyer, a partner in the Smith Law Firm, represents ABC Corp. in tax matters. ABC works with other companies (“customers") to reduce their income tax exposure.  ABC has created a new type of transaction which purportedly has significant tax advantages. ABC would like to market this new transaction to its customers. In order to make the new transaction more appealing to customers, ABC has asked Lawyer to prepare an opinion letter in which Lawyer opines on the tax advantages. ABC will give this opinion letter to customers and potential customers.  

-  May Lawyer prepare the opinion letter?
-  What should Lawyer do if she disagrees with ABC as to the tax advantages of the new transaction?

### Question 4

Anderson is an associate with the law firm of Peterson & Paulson. Peterson & Paulson are the only partners in the firm. Company hired Peterson to sue Competitor, who was selling products with similar names and packaging to Company's products. Peterson assigned Anderson to research the applicable law and draft a complaint. Anderson researched state law, but did not also research federal law. Based on that research, Anderson drafted a complaint asserting only a claim for unfair and deceptive trade practices under state law, which requires proof of intent to deceive. A reasonably competent lawyer would have also identified a potentially stronger claim under federal law, which does not require proof of intent. Peterson filed the complaint as drafted by Anderson, and served as the sole trial counsel. Paulson had no involvement in the case. Following a bench trial, the judge rendered a verdict in favor of Competitor, on the grounds that the evidence presented was insufficient to establish intent. Based on the same evidence presented at trial, Company would have prevailed on the federal claim.
