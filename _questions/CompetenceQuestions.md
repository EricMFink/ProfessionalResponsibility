## Question 1

Lawyer represents ABC Corp.  ABC has a very good breach of contract action against one of its regular customers, XYZ Corp.  ABC hires Lawyer to sue XYZ.  Lawyer advises ABC’s president that, “although you have a great lawsuit and I’m prepared to file the complaint, I do not think it is a wise business decision for you to sue a regular customer?”  Did Lawyer act properly?

## Question 2

Lawyer represents A in a child custody dispute.  A is the custodial parent of three children.  A’s former spouse, B, has filed the child custody suit in an attempt to obtain custody of the children.  A is a heavy drinker and has had considerable difficulty raising the children.  Lawyer advises A:  “I think you should seek treatment for your drinking and attend some parenting classes.”  Did Lawyer act properly?

## Question 3

Lawyer, a partner in the Smith Law Firm, represents ABC Corp. in tax matters. ABC works with other companies (“customers”) to reduce their income tax exposure.  ABC has created a new type of transaction which purportedly has significant tax advantages. ABC would like to market this new transaction to its customers. In order to make the new transaction more appealing to customers, ABC has asked Lawyer to prepare an opinion letter in which Lawyer opines on the tax advantages. ABC will give this opinion letter to customers and potential customers.  
   
-  May Lawyer prepare the opinion letter?
-  What should Lawyer do if she disagrees with ABC as to the tax advantages of the new transaction?
