<p class="C160"><b>Question 1a.</b></p>
<p class="C162">During his final year of college, Henry got excellent grades and achieved a very high LSAT score. However, during that year, he had two car accidents, ran up $11,500 in credit card debt, and was fired from his part-time restaurant job after he inexplicably failed to show up for work for ten days. Henry was then evaluated and diagnosed by a psychiatrist, who concluded that Henry suffered from bipolar disorder. This condition, if untreated, can cause extreme shifts in mood, energy, and ability to function. Henry’s doctor explained that what he went through during his senior year was a manic period. The doctor prescribed medication. Ever since, Henry has been taking his medication as prescribed. Henry’s doctor considers his illness “well-managed,” and has told Henry that it would not affect his ability to practice law.</p>
<p class="P107">Henry started law school three months after he finished college. Now he has completed law school, graduating at the top of his class. He is well-liked by his peers. During his third year, Henry enrolled in a clinical course. He won both of his cases and he received an A in the course.</p>
<p class="P107">Henry is applying for admission to the bar. The character and fitness questionnaire asks, among other questions:</p>
<p class="C408">1) Within the past five years, have you exhibited any conduct or behavior that could call into question your ability to practice law in a competent, ethical, and professional manner?</p>
<p class="C412">If you answered “yes,” furnish a thorough explanation below.</p>
<p class="C412">2) Do you currently have any condition or impairment (including, but not limited to, substance abuse, alcohol abuse, or a mental or emotional or nervous disorder or condition) that in any way affects your ability to practice law in a competent, ethical and professional manner?</p>
<p class="C412">If your answer is “yes,” are the limitations caused by your condition or impairment reduced or ameliorated because you receive ongoing treatment?</p>
<p class="C160">Henry believes that his disorder does not affect his ability to practice law in a competent, ethical and professional manner, and his physician agrees and has supplied him with a statement.</p>

<p class="C160"><b>Question 1b.</b></p>
<p class="C162">Josh, a third year law student, is planning to apply for admission to the bar. He just looked at the questionnaire of the National Conference of Bar Examiners, which he will have to submit. It asks:</p>
<p class="P116">Have you ever been dropped, suspended, warned, placed on scholastic or disciplinary probation, expelled, requested to resign, or allowed to resign in lieu of discipline from any college or university (including law school), or otherwise subjected to discipline by any institution or requested or advised by any institution to discontinue your studies there?</p>
<p class="C160">Four years ago, a residential advisor found alcoholic beverages in Josh’s dormitory room in violation of college rules. At a meeting with a dean, Josh agreed to be put on probation for one semester, during which he would be allowed to take classes as usual. If he made it through the semester without any more infractions, the incident would be expunged from his record. He completed the semester without incident, and the matter was therefore expunged from his college record and not recorded on his transcript. His law school asked a similar question on its admission application, and he answered “no” to the question.</p>
<p class="P107">Should Josh reveal the above-described incident in his character and fitness questionnaire? Which of the answers below is most accurate?</p>

This minor incident has no bearing on his fitness to practice law, so there is no reason to reveal it.</td>

<p class="C160"><b>Question 1c.</b></p>
<p class="C162">Leta graduated from law school one year ago and is applying for admission to the bar. While in law school, Leta accumulated $150,000 of debt from law school loans and credit card expenses related to her wedding. Upon graduation, Leta turned down a high-paying job at a prestigious law firm, choosing instead to work for $12 per hour at a public interest organization that represents indigent people in consumer and bankruptcy cases. She plans a career in consumer credit and bankruptcy law. She hopes that her work at the organization will eventually lead to a full-time public service job. Accordingly, she has not been able to begin paying off her debt. One credit card company has obtained a judgment against her for $7,000. The state bar has denied her application for admission to the bar because it finds that her conduct with respect to her finances indicates that she is not fit to practice law. Is the state bar’s position legally sustainable?</p>

Over the last few years, Carrie has noticed that Paige has been <span id="page_160" class="VST" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 160"><b>160</b></span>intoxicated during the workday. In the last few months, Carrie has been smelling alcohol on Paige’s breath during the workday at least two or three days a week. Paige continues to meet with clients and work on cases, but Carrie believes Paige’s work is suffering as a result of her drinking. In the past two weeks, she has received calls from three of Paige’s clients complaining that Paige either failed to show up for a meeting or failed to return a call. Last Tuesday, she found Paige passed out on the couch in her office at 11 am. There was vomit all over a client file that was on the floor near her head. Today she learned that a case that Paige was handling, to recover damages for a woman who was badly injured in an accident, was postponed for six months after Paige failed to appear for a court hearing. Carrie has tried to talk with Paige about her drinking problem, but Paige refuses to discuss it. Carrie is considering reporting Paige’s behavior to the disciplinary authorities. She has not discussed this with other attorneys in the firm or with any clients. Would Carrie be subject to discipline if she fails to report Paige’s conduct to the disciplinary authorities?</p>

<p class="C162">Sasha is an associate in the law firm of Garrett &amp; Glass, LLP. Recently, Sasha discovered that Gerry Glass, one of the partners, had stolen large sums of money from Healthwest, a client organization. In one case, for example, Gerry was defending Healthwest in a personal injury suit. Gerry reached a settlement under which Healthwest would pay the plaintiff $100,000, but he told the CEO of Healthwest that the organization was obliged to pay $200,000. Healthwest sent Gerry a check to cover the settlement. Gerry deposited the check in a firm account, paid the plaintiff $100,000, and wrote himself a check for the remainder. Gerry did this secretly. His law firm billed the client for legal fees as usual. Gerry repeated this same pattern in a series of cases over a seven-year period.</p>
<p class="P107">The evidence that Gerry has stolen funds from Healthwest is indisputable. Sasha explained the whole situation to the law firm’s general counsel. He instructed Sasha to keep the matter to herself. The general counsel, who is an old friend of Gerry’s, said that he didn’t “want to blow the matter out of proportion and hurt Gerry unnecessarily.” He said he would talk with Gerry about it and make sure that the clients were reimbursed and that the situation would not recur.</p>

<p class="C162">Carla, a graduating law student who is in the United States on a student visa, is having lunch with her friend Alice, an environmental lawyer who graduated from the same law school the previous year and who was just admitted to the bar. Carla knows that during law school, Alice did a summer internship at a small immigration law firm, where she helped companies that were seeking employment visas for some of their workers. Carla tells Alice that her student visa is about to expire, but that she has just been offered a job at a law firm. She asks whether the law firm could sponsor her for a visa. Alice responds, “Unfortunately, I don’t believe that law firms can sponsor people who are straight out of law school for employment visas. My advice would be to go back to your home country for a year and apply for jobs from there.” Carla, who reasonably believes that Alice was providing correct legal advice, turns down the law firm job and returns to her home country. A few months later, she learns that Alice’s advice was incorrect. The law firm could have sponsored her for a work visa. She tries to get the job back, but the firm informs her that it hired someone else and can no longer hire her. Alice’s advice was negligent and was the cause of Carla’s return to her home country and failure to get the job. Alice never signed a retainer, paid a fee, or otherwise agreed to be Carla’s lawyer. Carla sues Alice for negligence. May a court grant judgment against Alice for malpractice?</p>

If they come to us with an amount lower than that, and you think that we can get more by rejecting the offer, I trust your judgment. Do what you think is best.” The next day, Priya meets with opposing counsel, who informs her that the company is offering $3.25 million dollars to settle the case.

<p class="C162">In 2009, Anita, a criminal defense lawyer, represented Liam, an immigrant from Australia who was charged with selling cocaine. Under state law, if convicted, Liam could have been sentenced to five years in prison. The district attorney offered a deal providing that if Liam pled guilty, he would be sentenced to serve a term of 14 months. A criminal defense lawyer must give a client accurate advice about the potential adverse legal consequences of entering a guilty plea. Even so, without researching the potential immigration consequences of this guilty plea, Anita recommended that Liam accept the offer, and Liam did so. At the end of the 14 months, the state turned Liam over to federal immigration authorities, who deported him to Australia based on the criminal conviction. Liam cannot show that he would not have been convicted of a deportable offense if he had gone to trial. In 2010, the Supreme Court decided the <em>Padilla</em> case, holding that a conviction based on prejudicially incompetent plea-bargaining advice from a lawyer could be reversed. The highest court of the state has held that the <em>Padilla</em> decision does not apply to advice given before that decision. May Anita be subject to discipline?</p>

<p class="C162">Attorney Uma is a solo practitioner who represents Royce in a civil case. She is scheduled to argue an important motion at a hearing three days from now. She learns that her father has passed away, and his funeral will take place on the same day as the hearing. The judge has denied her motion for a continuance, because she has previously been granted four postponements of the argument of this motion.</p>
<p class="P107">Uma’s good friend Wendell is a seasoned litigator. She reasonably believes that he can competently represent Royce at the hearing, so she asks him if he can handle the hearing for her, and he agrees. He agrees to treat the file as confidential and to return it to Uma promptly after the hearing. Uma leaves a phone message for Royce, but he doesn’t return her call. She gives Wendell Royce’s file so that he can familiarize himself with the case. Assume that Wendell can competently represent the client at the hearing.</p>
<p class="P107">Was it proper for Uma to give Wendell the file?</p>

<p class="C162">Sophia retained Drake as her attorney to sue the city where she lived after she stepped into a deep hole in the sidewalk, fell, and broke her leg. She incurred $4,000 in medical bills and suffered a great deal of pain. State law provides that a city is not liable in suits for personal injury unless the suit is filed within one year after the injury occurs. Drake never filed the suit. Six months after the one-year period was up, Sophia sued Drake for malpractice, based on his failure to file the lawsuit.</p>
<p class="P107">In fact, Drake called Sophia five days before the one-year period was up and told her that he was ready to file, and Sophia told him not to go ahead with the case. When he asked why not, she said, “It is because I am a finalist for a job as the city’s commissioner of parks, and I probably won’t get the job if I sue the city. I’m telling you this in the strictest confidence. If I don’t get the job, I don’t want anyone, including my husband, to know that I applied for this job and didn’t get it.” Sophia was not selected for the job. She decided to sue Drake because she needed compensation for her injuries.</p>
<p class="P107">Drake asserted, in his answer to Sophia’s malpractice complaint, that Sophia told him not to file her suit because she was hoping to get a job as commissioner of parks. He limited the disclosure to the minimum necessary to defend himself against this spurious malpractice claim. Is Drake subject to discipline?</p>

Chad tells Alberto, his lawyer, that he could not have murdered Alan, because at the time of the murder, he was burying the body of another man, Ethan, whom he <em>had</em> killed. Ethan has been declared missing, and the police are investigating whether foul play has occurred. Chad tells Alberto where he buried Ethan.

Blake is accused of having prescribed Amaronset, a homeopathic compound to Eloise, a patient suffering from migraine headaches. Amaronset is not regulated by the FDA and it has not been widely used to treat migraines. Blake did not tell Eloise that the use of this substance was experimental. Three years after her treatment ended, Eloise died from a brain tumor. Her family is suing Blake, who is no longer prescribing Amaronset.</p>
<p class="P107">A study recently published in Germany found that 1 in 20 of the people who took Amaronset for more than two years developed malignant tumors. During the course of his representation, Blake tells Mosi that he prescribed Amaronset to two other individuals who suffered from migraines. They both took this compound for three years, and in both cases stopped taking it four years ago. These two patients do not know about the recent research on Amaronset or that Eloise died from a brain tumor. Blake refuses to inform these patients about the research or the demise of Eloise, because he does not want to open himself up to further liability.

PestOFF has recently been shown to cause birth defects if consumed, even in tiny amounts, by pregnant women, and its use within the state has been banned. Its use is a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for up to six months. The product was applied only once, and only to the floor of a closet where cleaning supplies were kept. It was never used near food. There is nothing to suggest any ingestion or injury to a person. A city ordinance requires anyone, including lawyers and doctors, who learns of the use of PestOFF to report it to local police immediately. Failure to report is a violation punishable by a $50 fine. Dahlia confronts Stefan and insists that he stop using this product and that they report his past use to the police. Stefan agrees to stop using the product but refuses to report his past use to the police. Dahlia then withdraws from representation of Stefan and reports Stefan’s use of PestOFF to the police.

Anthony altered a computer program so that he would be paid an extra few hundred dollars a month by the company. He got this higher pay every month for several years. Anthony’s theft from the company was noticed during an accounting audit and he is facing criminal charges.</p>
<p class="P107">During a meeting to discuss the criminal charges, Anthony tells Salima that he also rigged the program so that he would also receive approximately $200/ month that should have been paid to Jason, a custodian with six children. He says that after he was caught stealing, Anthony re-programmed the system so that the checks would be properly paid going forward. Neither Jason nor the company are aware that Anthony stole from Jason. Salima asked Anthony if he plans to fess up and repay Jason. He says “No way. I’m in enough trouble already.” Salima disapproves but says nothing.</p>
<p class="P107">Salima meets with the company’s general counsel to discuss restitution to the company. The general counsel tells Salima that the audit is complete and presents an accounting that lists only the money that Anthony stole from the company.</p>
<p class="P107">Salima reasonably believes that unless she reveals the theft, there will be no restitution to Jason. May Salima reveal this information without Anthony’s consent?</p>

<p class="C160"><b>Question 4l.</b></p>
<p class="C162">In the course of representing Frostco, Inc., Caroline receives a visit from Mark, a Frostco employee. She explains at the outset that she represents Frostco, not Mark. He says he understands that but needs to tell her about a problem “off the record.” Mark says that the sales contracts that Caroline prepared for Frostco over a period of years included fraudulent misrepresentations about the durability of the refrigerators that Frostco was selling to distributors. Mark provides Caroline with secret internal memos in which company officers acknowledged that the refrigerators have substandard compressors that will last for only a tenth of the useful life stated in the contracts. These defects will cause substantial financial losses to the distributors, because the refrigerators will not work without functioning compressors, and many buyers probably will sue for breach of warranty. Caroline knows that <span id="page_172" class="VST" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 172"><b>172</b></span>Frostco probably will not be able to make good on the warranty claims because it does not have enough money to repair or replace all the refrigerators.</p>
<p class="P107">Caroline confronts the general counsel of Frostco, who directs her to back off and continue preparing the contracts. He declines to address the product defect or to scale back the warranty claims in new contracts. He says, “If you don’t want our business, we will find another lawyer who will write these contracts.” Caroline decides to withdraw from representation of Frostco. May Caroline tell the distributors that her client misrepresented the durability of the refrigerators?</p>

<p class="C162">Attorney Yoshi represented client Cyrus in his divorce. During the course of the representation, Cyrus told Yoshi that if his ex-wife, Tisha, was awarded their beachfront vacation home in Florida, he would burn it down when it is vacant, because he could not stand the thought of his ex-wife using the vacation home without him. Yoshi advises Cyrus that this is a terrible idea. He points out that deliberate arson could lead to criminal charges and civil liability, not to mention termination of visitation rights. He also cautions that Cyrus could injure or kill a member of his family if he burns down that house. Cyrus repeats to Yoshi that he would not do this if anyone was in the house, but he does not assure Yoshi that he won’t torch the building. The divorce was finalized, and Tisha was awarded the vacation home. Yoshi has terminated his lawyer-client relationship with Cyrus. Yoshi reasonably believes that revelation is necessary to prevent Cyrus from committing a crime that is reasonably certain to result in substantial injury to Tisha’s house. May Yoshi warn Tisha or her attorney that Cyrus is planning to burn down the vacation home?</p>

<p class="C162">The police arrested a middle school band teacher for repeatedly sexually abusing numerous female students aged 9 to 12. The molestation occurred during private music lessons and took place over a seven-year period before the teacher was arrested. Some of the victims told the police that they had reported the abuse to the school principal after it occurred, but the principal had failed to take action against the teacher. After the teacher was arrested, some of the victims and their families filed suit against the principal and the school board. The school board hired the firm of Schoenholtz &amp; Koplow “to investigate the response of the school administration to allegations of sexual abuse of students.” The board explained that it would need a full report so that it could decide whether to settle or litigate the claims against it. Meanwhile, the school board also hired a respected trial lawyer, Lindsay, at another firm, to represent the board in the lawsuit. Schoenholtz &amp; Koplow interviewed all the officers of the school board to find out what they knew about the molestation, when they learned what they knew, and what they did after they received the information. Their notes and report were turned over to the school board, which gave them to Lindsay.

The lawyers for Metropolitan Hospital have learned about Pierre’s presence during the meetings between Juan and Alton. The hospital is seeking discovery of the conversations that took place during those meetings. Which one of the following statements is correct?</p>

<p class="C162">Paula, a lawyer, drafted a will for Viet. The will stated that in the event of his death, his property should go to “my children.” Viet and his wife Jenny had two sons. After his death, Edith, a woman with whom he had had an affair, proved through DNA evidence that he also had fathered her son Michael. She claimed that her son was entitled to one third of the estate. During probate of the will, Paula plans to testify that Viet had told her that what he meant was that his property should go to his children Gabriel and Veronique, and any children that he and Jenny later produced. Since Jenny is next of kin, Paula has obtained her informed consent to this plan. Paula would assert that she was waiving the privilege on behalf of her deceased client.</p>
<p class="C162">Edith’s lawyer objects on the ground that Paula’s testimony would violate the attorney-client privilege. Should the probate judge allow Paula to testify about Viet’s intent?</p>

<p class="C162">Last year, attorney Mira represented Sally, the owner of a small pizza restaurant, in a suit against Rome’s Own, Inc., a supplier of shredded cheese, based on breach of contract. The parties settled the claim for $15,000. Mira and Sally remained friendly after the matter was settled, and have gone to the movies and to dinner a few times in the last year. Earlier today, Sally’s next door neighbor, Jose, came in to Mira’s office for a consultation and asked Mira to represent him in a civil suit against Sally. Jose alleges that Sally’s pet macaw bit him, causing an infection and permanent scarring. Jose wants to get a court order against Sally requiring that the bird be euthanized pursuant to a state law. Sally already paid for his medical care. Jose does not want further damages. Must Mira obtain Sally’s informed consent before she can agree to represent Jose?</p>

Those matters are all completed. Five years ago, Shawn wrote a will for Evelyn in which she left all of her property to Adelaide. In that work, Shawn represented and gave advice to both Evelyn and Adelaide. Adelaide, who lives with her mother, suffers from disabling epilepsy and has not been able to support herself. After Shawn finished drafting the will, he drafted a letter to Evelyn and Adelaide informing them that his office was closing their file and confirming the termination of their lawyer-client relationship. However, he failed to mail them the letter.</p>
<p class="P107">Last week, Evelyn came to Shawn to tell him that it’s time for Adelaide to stand on her own two feet.

She would like Shawn to write a new will for her in which she would leave all of her property to Oliver. She further asks Shawn not to reveal to Adelaide the contents of the new will.</p>

<p class="C162">Kieran, five years out of law school, accepted a job with Sato &amp; Perlmutter, LLP. A couple of months after he started work, Miranda Perlmutter was asked to take over representation of Kasho Natural Foods in an ongoing lawsuit against the Roxbury Box Company. Kasho had fired its previous counsel after a dispute over legal fees. Miranda wants to accept Kasho as a client. However, there may be a problem.</p>
<p class="P107">Kieran came to Sato &amp; Perlmutter from another firm, Podkrash and Associates, LLP, where he had worked for three years. The Podkrash firm has been representing the Roxbury Box Company in the Kasho litigation for the last two years. Kieran did not work on the Roxbury matter while he worked at Podkrash. While Kieran was working at Podkrash, he dated Lance, the senior paralegal at the firm. Lance oversaw all the staff work on the Roxbury matter and talked at length about the factual and strategic issues in the case with Kieran on many occasions. For example, the two men talked about a decision of the partner in charge of the litigation that a key document that might impact Roxbury’s liability was not covered by the plaintiffs’ discovery request. Lance disagreed with the partner’s decision, but ultimately decided to keep his mouth shut.</p>
<p class="P107">After consultation with her firm’s ethics counsel, Miranda decides to undertake representation of Kasho. However, she does not wish to terminate Kieran’s employment as a way to solve any conflicts problem. Instead, she timely screens Kieran from the lawyers working on the matter, sees to it that he receives no part of the fee from the Kasho matter, and provides appropriate written notices to Roxbury about the screening procedures.</p>
<p class="P107">Was Sato &amp; Perlmutter permitted to undertake representation of Kasho in this manner?</p>

<p class="C162">Larry, the father of Linda, Abby, and Carl, died at age 87. His property was to be divided equally among his children. Louise, Larry’s partner, is executor of the estate. Most of his property is in cash and stocks, but Larry also left his children a lakeside cabin. The three adult children decide that Carl should take the cabin and should pay his sisters one-third of its value each out of his share of the cash and stocks. The appraised value of the cabin is $225,000, but Carl urges that, for the purpose of the transfer, the cabin should be valued at <span id="page_188" class="VST" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 188"><b>188</b></span>$150,000, because he believes the appraised value is unrealistic and that he will soon have to replace the water and septic systems for the cabin, at considerable cost. After some discussion, Linda and Abby are willing to go along with their brother’s suggestion as to the valuation of the cabin because they care more about their brother than they do about the money. The three siblings need to hire legal assistance to prepare and file the documents relating to the transfer of the cabin. Carl proposes that they hire Morton, a lawyer he has used for other legal matters over the last ten years. Morton reasonably believes that he could competently represent all three siblings. He explains the potential problems and the advantages and risks of joint representation and obtains their consent to the joint representation. None of the siblings has any questions or new proposals, and he does not provide any legal advice to them. Morton then prepares a document valuing the cabin at $150,000 for purposes of the transfer, just as the siblings agreed. Each sibling confirms that all of them still want him to be their attorney. May he represent all three siblings in the transaction?</p>

<p class="C162">Jaiden, an assistant general counsel of Plenum, Inc., a pharmaceutical manufacturer, was asked to investigate whether the research division of Plenum was concealing reports of adverse reactions to the company’s best-selling product, Somalox, an anti-depressant. <span id="page_189" class="VST" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 189"><b>189</b></span>Two users of Somalox had contacted the general counsel’s office, reporting that they had submitted adverse reaction reports to the research division, as directed on the package insert, but that they had received no response from the company. One of these two users alleged that he had suffered hallucinations and suicidal ideation after taking Somalox, and that he had described these reactions in his earlier report. The other user reported that she was hospitalized for depression after having taken Somalox for several weeks. She also had reported this to the research division. The non-response is worrisome. The company policy is to acknowledge receipt of any adverse reaction reports and to assure users that the company will report adverse reactions to the Food and Drug Administration as required by law. The research division would route any adverse reaction reports through the general counsel’s office to the FDA, but none have been received or sent for Somalox.</p>
<p class="P107">Jaiden schedules a meeting with Bertha, the chief of the research division. Jaiden shows her the correspondence sent to the general counsel’s office by the two users and asks her to show him these and any other adverse reaction reports that the company has received. Bertha flushes and stammers in response to Jaiden’s query. “I am afraid that I have let a few of these slip through the cracks. Since you are the company’s lawyer, I can speak to you in confidence, right? Am I in trouble here?”</p>
<p class="P107">In answering Bertha’s questions, which of the following statements would Jaiden be best advised to make?</p>

<p class="C160"><b>Question 8g.</b></p>
<p class="C162">Eleanor represents Carmichael Inc., an energy company that sells electricity to residential and commercial customers. The corporation has five stockholders; four are Carmichael family members, and the fifth is an outside investor who provided start-up funds five years ago. In the course of her review of corporate documents, including e-mails exchanged among company personnel, Eleanor discovers that Marcus, the company’s Director of Information Technology, has been harvesting cell phone numbers from employees’ and customers’ e-mail messages that went through the company’s server and selling them to telemarketing companies. This information about Marcus’s activities, if it became public, would be very damaging to Carmichael Inc.’s reputation. She consults Carmichael’s president, Joseph Carmichael, who says that he has suspected that something like this might be happening, but that Eleanor should just leave it alone. Eleanor suspects that Joseph may be collaborating with Marcus and sharing the revenue from the telemarketing companies. Eleanor goes to a meeting of the board of directors that is attended only by Joseph and his wife and son, who are also members of the board, and Joseph again tells her to leave it alone. His wife and son concur. The company is regulated by the Public Service Commission. Eleanor continues to believe that exposure would hurt the company’s reputation and therefore its future profits.</p>

<p class="C160"><b>Question 9a.</b></p>
<p class="C162">Lucille, a criminal defense lawyer, receives a frantic call from Sylvia, who states that her sister, Basia, who recently immigrated from Poland, has been arrested by state police for a drug violation, and that the bail hearing will be held in less than two hours. She asks Lucille to represent Basia at the bail hearing and in her criminal case. Lucille hires Magda, a Polish-speaking interpreter, and rushes to the courthouse, where she is able to briefly meet with Basia and represent her at the bail hearing. The judge sets the bail at $2,000. Sylvia is able to pay the bail amount, and Basia is released from prison that night. The next day, Lucille meets with Basia, with Magda interpreting, and informs her that her rate for legal services is $300 per hour. She states that that rate will be used to calculate the bill for the work that Lucille did on the bail hearing, and for future work that she will do on the criminal case. Basia agrees to the rate and Lucille begins work on her case. There is no other discussion of how much Basia will have to pay. At Basia’s hearing five months later, the arresting officer fails to appear, and the charges against Basia are dropped. The next month, Lucille sends Basia a bill for $1,800, including five hours of her work, plus $300 for Magda’s services. Is Lucille subject to discipline?</p>

<p class="C162">Spencer desires to represent his golfing partner Craig, who was injured on a ski slope that was apparently negligently maintained. Spencer tells Craig on the phone that he is willing to work on a contingent fee basis, under which Craig will be charged nothing unless Spencer obtains a settlement or wins a judgment. In either case, Spencer would charge 33 percent of any recovery after the deduction of the expenses of litigation. Spencer explains that Craig will not be responsible for any litigation expenses unless there is a recovery that exceeds the amount of the expenses. They discuss these points, and Craig agrees to the fee arrangement. Spencer contacts the ski slope’s insurer, and within three weeks, with Craig’s approval, the case is settled for $21,000. Spencer transmits $14,000 of that settlement to Craig. Spencer spent only four hours on the case. Was Spencer’s conduct proper?</p>

At that time, Maria charged her an hourly fee of $400 per hour. The judge granted the divorce and ordered Jack to pay her $1,000 per month child support.

Ted must get a certain medication that costs $1,400 in the next 24 hours or else he will go into kidney failure.

Danielle is flat broke (in fact, she is deeply in debt), but there is $120,000 in Danielle’s trust account. This amount is the proceeds of a personal injury settlement that Danielle will distribute to her client Van. She represented him on a pro bono basis, so she is not owed a fee from the settlement. Van is in prison for the next few years. Danielle has agreed to hold the funds for Van in the interim and to make mortgage payments on his house as they become due. Danielle lends Matthew $1,400 from this account for Ted’s medication. She is unable to ask for Van’s approval because he is in solitary confinement because he talked back to a prison guard and is not allowed to receive phone calls. Danielle, confident that Van would approve, sends him a letter explaining her intention to make the loan to her brother. A week later, Matthew receives the proceeds from the sale of his house. He repays Danielle, who replenishes the client trust account. Van later writes Danielle that he is glad that she was able to make the loan to her brother.

Abdul wants to represent Blaine in a suit against the United States in the federal Tax Court to try to obtain the withheld portion of Blaine’s refund. He would not charge Blaine any fee. Also, Abdul has spoken to his supervisor in the Department of Labor, who has confirmed that the Department would have no objection to Abdul providing legal assistance to Blaine in his dispute with the Internal Revenue Service and will confirm this in writing. As a result, Abdul is confident that there is no conflict of interest, and he does not intend to advise Blaine that he should get a different lawyer, because any other lawyer would charge a substantial fee to Blaine. May Abdul represent Blaine in this litigation?</p>

<p class="C160"><b>Question 10c.</b></p>
<p class="C162">After she graduated from law school, Dania worked for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for three years. During that time, she worked on securing an indictment in a large securities case involving seven defendants who collaborated on an insider trading scheme. At the end of three years, she moved on to a position at one office of a large private law firm whose practice includes defense of securities fraud cases. A month after she started work at the firm, Dania learned that a partner in the firm was representing one of the defendants in the securities case that Dania had worked on while she was at the SEC. This did not emerge in the preliminary conflicts screening before she was hired because Dania’s work focused on three of the other defendants in the suit. The basic facts were the same, but the targets were different. What should the firm do to enable it to represent the defendant in the securities fraud case?</p>

<p class="C162">Evelyn, a recently admitted attorney, is serving as a law clerk to Judge Leopold Osterman on the state court of appeals. The judge has heard the appeal in a contract dispute in which IGL Corp. has sued Mountain Hardware, Inc., for damages. Mountain Hardware was represented by the law firm of Westerfield &amp; Pilson, which Evelyn worked for during her second summer in law school. She did not work on that dispute while she was at the firm, because the firm accepted it after she left the job, but Judge Osterman has asked her to write the opinion in the case. While she was working on the opinion, Margaret Pilson from Westerfield &amp; Pilson emailed Evelyn, on her private email account, asking whether she would like to discuss joining the firm as an associate after she finished her clerkship. Evelyn wanted to take that job, so she told Judge Osterman about the email, and he said that it was fine to discuss a possible job with the firm. Evelyn and the firm then agreed on a starting salary of $95,000, and that she would begin work two weeks after her clerkship ended. A week later, Evelyn completed the opinion, which the judge adopted. It dismissed the case against Mountain Hardware. Is Evelyn subject to discipline?</p>

So without first notifying Manfred, she telephoned the judge’s clerk to find out whether the argument on the motion could be heard the following week. To her surprise, the judge picked up the phone and explained that he had answered because his clerk was at lunch. Erin explained the situation and asked the judge whether the argument could be scheduled for November 12. The judge checked his computer and advised that he could fit in the argument on that date, and he advised Erin to notify Manfred of her request and if Manfred had no objection, to telephone his clerk in a few hours. He said that his clerk would also send a notice to her and to Manfred, describing his conversation with Erin and notifying that in the absence of any objection, the hearing would be rescheduled as requested.

During a meeting at the prison, Carl tells Ria that on the night of the alleged robbery, he was at a hockey game with his girlfriend. When Ria returns to her office, she does an Internet search and finds out that the hockey game actually took place on the night before the robbery, not the night of the robbery. Ria tells Carl this information during their next meeting, and Carl tells her he was mistaken. He says he went to the hockey game the night before the robbery, and on the night of the robbery, he was having dinner with his mother an hour away from where the robbery took place. Ria reasonably thinks that Carl probably is lying about the dinner with his mother. Without first counseling Carl to tell the truth, she refuses to allow Carl to testify about the dinner at his trial. Is her refusal proper?</p>

<p class="C160"><b>Question 11e.</b></p>
<p class="C162">Athena practices law in a city of medium size. She specializes in trusts and estates and in elder law. For many years, Athena lived next door to Meredith, an elderly widow. Meredith lived with her middle-aged daughter Dora, but spent most of her time with her boyfriend, Sven. Athena did not do any legal work for Meredith, though she got to know her well. At Meredith’s request, a year ago Athena acted as one of two subscribing witnesses to Meredith’s most recent will. This new will replaced an earlier will which had left everything to Dora. The new will left $500,000 to Dora, $1,000,000 to Sven, and the rest of Meredith’s multi-million-dollar estate to charity. Meredith named her cousin Ernest as her executor. The other witness to the new will died in February.</p>
<p class="P107">Meredith died last week. Dora has announced that she plans to contest the will on the ground that Meredith was incompetent when she executed the will. Athena probably will be required to testify in the probate proceeding on the subject of Meredith’s competency at the time she signed the will. Ernest, the executor, has asked Athena to represent him and defend the will in the probate proceeding. Athena has never before represented Dora, Sven, or Ernest.</p>
<p class="P107">Athena wants to represent Ernest in probating the will, and also to testify truthfully that she knew Meredith well and that Meredith appeared to her to be competent. Is her proposed conduct proper?</p>

<p class="C160"><b>Question 11f.</b></p>
<p class="C162">Hussain, a lawyer, represents Surety, Inc., an automobile insurance company that insures rental car companies. Lee was seriously injured when the brakes on his rental car failed. Through his lawyer, Esther, Lee sued the rental car company, and pursuant to his agreement with Surety, Hussain represented the defendant in the lawsuit. Surety’s investigation revealed that the brakes were faulty and the rental car company is therefore liable. Hussain knew that Esther had not done her own forensic investigation of the brakes. Surety authorized Hussain to offer Lee up to $500,000 to settle the suit. When Esther and Hussain met to explore whether a negotiated settlement was possible, Esther said her client was willing to accept a settlement of $400,000. Hussain said, “I know that my client won’t pay a penny more than $300,000.” Is Hussain subject to discipline for lying to Esther?</p>

<p class="C160"><b>Question 11g.</b></p>
<p class="C162">Attorney Mort represents Julio, who was injured in an automobile accident caused by Yvonne. Julio has back pain and frequent, severe headaches. Julio is suing Yvonne and will soon have his deposition taken. When Mort interviewed Julio and asked him how frequently he had severe headaches, Julio said, “I don’t have them every day, and sometimes they aren’t so bad. But about four days a week, I wake up with a severe headache.” Mort told Julio that minimizing the frequency of his head pain would weaken his case. Julio asked Mort what he should say. Mort said, “Well you don’t have to say, unless you are asked, that you don’t have headaches every day, or that they aren’t so bad.” Julio said, “So, what should I say?” Mort said, “I understand that you wake up most mornings with severe headaches? Isn’t that right?” Julio said, “That’s right.” Mort said, “When I ask you about your headaches, you can say: ‘Most mornings, I wake up with severe headaches.’ ”</p>
<p class="P107">Julio testified in the deposition that he woke up most days with severe headaches, and he was not asked more questions about this subject. The case was settled shortly thereafter. However, Julio got into a dispute with Mort about the calculations of Mort’s fee, and Julio filed a bar complaint against Mort. During the investigation by the bar counsel’s office, Julio described how Mort had coached him to testify regarding his headaches. Is Mort subject to discipline for his conduct regarding Julio’s testimony?</p>

<p class="C160"><b>Question 11h.</b></p>
<p class="C162">Libby, a lawyer, represents Lawncare Enterprises, the defendant in a negligence case. Lawncare Enterprises manufactures power lawn mowers. Pierre, the plaintiff, had purchased <span id="page_206" class="VST" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 206"><b>206</b></span>a Model LC-15 Lawncare mower. One day when Pierre was operating the mower, the mower hit a small stone, which flew up and hit Pierre’s left eye, blinding that eye permanently. Pierre claims that Lawncare knew or should have known that the protective shield on the mower he used was too short to prevent an accident of this type. During preparation for trial, Libby asked Ira, Lawncare’s chief of customer relations, whether his department had received other complaints of stones or other small objects being thrown up during use of the Model LC-15. Ira said that the department had received more than two dozen such complaints, about half of which had involved minor injuries, but no serious injuries.</p>
<p class="P107">During the trial, Ira was asked on cross-examination whether his department had received any prior complaints of injuries resulting from the use of the Model LC-15. Ira replied that there had been two or three complaints of scratches from debris kicked up by the mower, but none of those were serious, and none of those incidents had resulted in litigation. Libby observed this testimony by Ira without betraying, through her expressions or otherwise, that it was inconsistent with what Ira had told her earlier about the number of injuries that had been reported.</p>
<p class="P107">A jury ruled in favor of Lawncare, and Pierre appealed. While she is working on the appeal, Libby visits the Lawncare factory and runs into Ira. She asks him why he had told her that about half of the two dozen complaints about the LC-15 resulted in injuries but then testified that there had been only two or three complaints of scratches. Ira replies that Lawncare’s general counsel had advised him to testify truthfully but to try to minimize how much Lawncare knew about prior injuries caused by the product. He added that he had been careful to say that there had been two or three complaints of scratches, without saying that those had been the <em>only</em> complaints of injuries.</p>
<p class="P107">What if anything should Libby do as a result of this disclosure?</p>

<p class="C160"><b>Question 12a.</b></p>
<p class="C162">Maude, a lawyer, was retained by Anya, who lives in an assisted-living building for elderly persons. Anya noticed that many residents of the building were contracting respiratory infections. Anya has noticed that the ceiling tiles by some of the air vents in her apartment have turned black, an indicator of mold in the HVAC system. She suspected that Warner Management, Inc., which was running the building, was cutting costs, and had not been servicing the air conditioning and heating systems often enough. Regular servicing and changing the filters quarterly is necessary to maintain clean indoor air.</p>
<p class="P107">Maude wants to question Xavier, the Warner employee who services the heating and air conditioning systems and changes the filters at Anya’s building. Under the substantive law of the jurisdiction, if Xavier reveals that he failed to service the system or change the filters regularly, Warner Management could be liable for his negligence on the theory of <em>respondeat superior</em>. Maude knows that Warner is represented by attorney Peter in all matters related to Anya’s building. Maude is planning to tell Xavier that she represents Anya but is not planning to tell him that he has a right to consult with counsel of his choice. Also, she does not plan to ask Peter’s permission to question Xavier, or even to notify Peter that she is interviewing him. May she question Xavier without getting Peter’s permission?</p>

<p class="C160"><b>Question 12d.</b></p>
<p class="C162">Tomas, an attorney, represented the IWT Corporation, which fired a woman named Celinda. IWT claims that Celinda’s written work was sloppy; Celinda claimed that IWT simply wanted to give the job to a younger person. She wanted her job back or a substantial cash settlement. Pursuant to a clause in Celinda’s employment contract, her dispute had to be resolved through arbitration. While the arbitration proceeding was pending, IWT’s general counsel read the emails that Celinda had sent to Tomas through the company’s email system, from the time that Celinda received notice that she was being fired until a month later, when she actually departed. IWT’s 250-page office handbook, a copy of which <span id="page_209" class="VST" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 209"><b>209</b></span>was given to Celinda two years ago, says on page 138 that the e-mail system belongs to the company and that information sent over the system may be read or disclosed by company officials. One of Celinda’s e-mails said, “I know that my work isn’t as good as it used to be, and that I have been making a lot of mistakes this year. So maybe they do have good reason to fire me after all.” IWT’s general counsel sent a copy of this e-mail to Tomas. Tomas did not tell Celinda’s lawyer that he had a copy of the email, planning to use it to surprise her during the arbitration proceeding. Is Tomas subject to discipline?</p>

The police did not attempt to question Donald, and Craig arranged for him to be released on bail at his arraignment, after Donald was read the charges filed against him and given a court date. Craig filed papers informing the court and the prosecutor’s office that he would be representing Donald in the matter. Brenda, a prosecutor, was assigned responsibility for Donald’s case. A state statute authorizes prosecutors to investigate criminal cases by questioning witnesses or authorizing police officials to do so up to the point at which charges are filed. Brenda visited Donald’s home a week after he <span id="page_210" class="VST" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 210"><b>210</b></span>was released, identified herself as the prosecutor in the case, and asked if she might ask him some questions. Donald said he would answer her questions because he was innocent of the charges and therefore had nothing to hide. Brenda did not make any false or misleading statements to Donald. On the basis of information from his answers, Brenda was able to contact and interview other witnesses. She did not offer into evidence any information that she received from Donald. Is Brenda subject to discipline?</p>

<p class="C160"><b>Question 12g.</b></p>
<p class="C162">Five years ago, Tammy was murdered at night while alone in her home. Her boyfriend Ray, with whom she had been quarreling, was accused of the crime. At first he claimed innocence and said she must have been killed by an intruding stranger. Initially, he declined the opportunity to consult a lawyer. After 12 hours of police questioning, he confessed to the crime. Subsequently, he retained Ming, a lawyer. Ray was convicted, largely on the basis of his confession, and was sentenced to 40 years in prison. Ray is now in prison.</p>
<p class="P107">Daniel, a prosecutor in the county where Ray was tried, recently negotiated a plea bargain with the attorney for Burt, another man who was alleged to have committed several murders. Burt agreed to plead guilty to manslaughter and to receive a life sentence to avoid being charged with a capital offense. Part of the deal is that he would provide Daniel with details on his other crimes. During those discussions, Burt revealed that he had robbed and killed Tammy. He had dated her a year earlier, but she had rejected him in favor of Ray. Burt consents to provide a sample of his blood, which matches the blood that was found in Tammy’s house the day after the murder. Ray’s blood had not been found in the house. What if anything must Daniel do?</p>

<p class="C162">Herman was mugged in a dark alley, and his wallet, which contained $200 in $20 bills, was stolen. Moments after the assailant fled with his money, Herman spotted a police officer and reported the crime. Herman described the assailant as a male who had dark hair, was of medium height, and wore a dark colored shirt and white sneakers. He said the assailant had showed him a knife. The officer alerted other officers in the vicinity by radio. An officer arrested Juan three blocks away. Juan has dark hair and is of medium height. He was wearing a dark blue shirt and white sneakers. When searched, he was found to have $454 in cash in his pocket, including eight twenty dollar bills. He was not in possession of a knife. When arrested, Juan acted suspiciously and refused to answer any questions. He has not confessed. Herman’s wallet was never found, and no knife was found in the vicinity. The case was <span id="page_211" class="VST" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 211"><b>211</b></span>assigned to Marcella, a prosecutor.

The Woodbridge driver claimed, at the time, that Yvonne drove right in front of him and that the accident was her fault. Yvonne hired Kate, a lawyer, to sue the Supermarket. Kate has learned that Nora, a cashier employed by Woodbridge, witnessed the accident because she was standing outside the store during a ten-minute work break. Nora has no responsibility for driving delivery trucks or maintaining the parking lot. Kate wants to interview Nora, but she suspects that Woodbridge’s lawyers (if asked) would decline permission for her to conduct this interview and would insist that she initiate formal discovery. Kate does not want to incur the expense of discovery without having an idea of what Nora would say. Kate is not planning to give Woodbridge’s lawyers any prior notice that she is interviewing Nora, much less ask their permission, and she is not planning to advise Nora that she has a right to consult either Woodbridge’s lawyers or a lawyer of her own choosing before talking to Kate. May Kate interview Nora, away from Woodbridge’s premises, under these conditions?</p>

<p class="C162">Samir practices family law. His clients often have problems that might better be addressed by a marital counselor, who might be able to help a divorcing couple to reconcile or to separate more amicably. He wants to form a partnership with his cousin Veena, a licensed social worker. They would share a suite of offices, and a client could receive services from either or both of them, as the client preferred. Samir and Veena want to share the fees earned by either of them, in proportion to the work done by each. Samir will take steps to ensure that Veena complies with the Rules of Professional Conduct. Veena will not direct or regulate Samir’s professional judgment in rendering legal services, and all clients will be informed that only Samir is licensed to practice law. However, Samir does not plan to seek each client’s written consent to receive legal services from a partnership that includes a social worker who is not also a lawyer. May they create this partnership?</p>

Troy worked as a salesperson for three years for Glory Vacations, Inc., which sells vacation timeshares. Heidi, one of Glory’s customers, has sued both Glory and Troy for $50,000, alleging that Troy made fraudulent statements while selling her some timeshare property. Upon receiving the summons, Glory fired Troy and cross-claimed against Troy, claiming that any fraud was unauthorized and is Troy’s fault. Troy says he is being scapegoated and never made any false statements.</p>
<p class="P107">Troy wants Samantha to represent him. He is now unemployed and has very little money. Samantha cannot afford to accept him as a pro bono client. Troy says that he has been turned down by several other lawyers because of his financial situation. He owns a house, so the local legal services office will not represent him. Without representation, Troy, whose formal education ended after high school, will be unable to defend himself effectively. He asks Samantha whether he has a due process right to have the court appoint a lawyer to represent him without charge.</p>

<p class="C162">Mindy represents RenTV, which leases television sets by the month to people who do not have enough money to buy televisions. Some of its customers, represented by Ross, brought a class action against it for failure to comply with the federal Truth-in-Lending Act. That law provides that the lawyer for a prevailing plaintiff may recover attorney’s fees from the defendant in addition to the judgment. RenTV is willing to pay $120,000 to the members of the class to settle the suit. But it does not want any of the settlement money to be paid to Ross, the plaintiff’s attorney, because Mindy and RenTV believe that he will just use the money to bring more troublesome litigation against RenTV or other companies owned by RenTV’s parent company. May Mindy condition the settlement offer on Ross’s waiver of attorney fees?</p>

<p class="C160"><b>Question 14e.</b></p>
<p class="C162">Warren, a lawyer, represented Carrie, a state university student, in a lawsuit challenging her state’s restrictive voter identification law. The retainer agreement specifies that Warren would not charge Carrie a fee but may keep, as his fee, any counsel fees that the court requires the state to pay.</p>
<p class="P107">A state law allows out-of-state students to vote, but it requires voters to supply photo identification. Pursuant to regulation, the state accepts many forms of picture identification, including passports, in-state driver’s licenses, and gun licenses, but it does not accept out-of-state driver’s licenses. Carrie only has an out-of-state driver’s license. After Warren filed a civil rights suit in federal court on her behalf, the state changed its regulation to allow out-of-state driver’s licenses to qualify as identification. The state attorney general explained to the press, “We didn’t think that the court would sustain our regulation.” Warren has signed an agreement with the state attorney general in which he agreed to withdraw the lawsuit and the attorney general agreed, on behalf of the state, to accept out-of-state driver’s licenses as photo identification for purposes of voting for at least 25 years. Now Warren plans to request the court to award him counsel fees based on the time he spent researching the law and filing the suit.</p>
