### Question 1

In 1985, you represented A. A and B were accused of killing V. Prior to trial, A confessed to you that he (A) was the sole killer of V and that B was not involved. You believe A's confession was truthful. A's confession was not disclosed at trial. As a result, both A and B were convicted of murder and both were sentenced to life in prison. In 2002, A commits suicide in prison. In 2003, B moves for a new trial. You are convinced that B is innocent, so you wish to voluntarily testify at the B's hearing about your 1985 conversation with A in which A confessed to being the sole murderer. 

Should you do so?

### Question 2 

Your long-time client, John Carter, recently came to your office to tell you that he expects to be sued by the person who bought his house. He had told the buyer that the house had a dry basement. Although the basement had never flooded in the five years that he had lived there, Carter had been told by a prior owner that the basement regularly flooded after a heavy rain. There was such a rain this year, and the buyer's furniture was destroyed.

Shortly before his death, you were able to interview the prior owner of the house, who told you what he had told Carter about the flooding. You have notes of that interview in which you comment on the former owner's likely credibility at trial. In addition, while at a party, Carter's banker let slip that Carter is in bad financial condition. The buyer has now filed suit against Carter.

- The buyer has subpoenaed you to give a deposition. What information must you disclose?
- The buyer has subpoenaed any documents you have related to the case. What must you disclose?
- One of your college friends, who is about to loan money to Carter, has informally asked you about Carter's financial condition. You would like to help your college friend. What may you disclose?
- If Carter is compelled to testify at trial, may he use the attorney-client privilege as a basis for refusing to disclose the conversation he had with the prior owner?

### Question 4

In a federal investigation of Defendant for tax fraud, the grand jury by subpoena requests a letter written January 15 by Defendant to her attorney in which she stated: â€œPlease prepare a deed giving my ranch to University but, in order to get around the tax law, I want it back-dated to December 15."

Must attorney produce the letter?

### Question 5

Attorney represents Client in a civil commitment proceeding. During a break in the proceeding, Client confidentially tells Attorney that he (Client) intends to commit suicide at the next break.

### Question 6

On June 1, Owner consults Attorney about a motor vehicle collision resulting in a suit by P against Owner. Attorney calls E, an expert he has hired to testify in this case, into the conference to make notes of what is said, and those present discuss the facts of the collision. A few weeks later, Attorney is subpoenaed by the grand jury and asked to disclose the substance of her June 1 conversation with Owner. 

Must Attorney disclose such information?

### Question 7

H, newly elected mayor of Hollywood, was charged with tax fraud. The District Attorney served a subpoena directing G, H's attorney, to produce some private bank records that H had delivered to G. 

Must G produce the records?

### Question 8

An attorney represents a company that produces chemical products. Some of the waste products that the company manufactures are highly toxic and are likely to cause serious immediate physical harm if disposed of improperly. The president of the company recently informed the attorney that a new employee mistakenly disposed of the waste products in the ground behind the company plant, an area that is part of the source of the city's water supply. The attorney advised the president that the company could be liable for negligence in lawsuits brought by any persons harmed by the waste products. As a result, the attorney advised the president to immediately report the problem to city authorities. Fearful of adverse publicity, the president declined to do so. The attorney further advised the president that she believed the president's decision was immoral. The president continued to decline to report the matter. The attorney then informed the president that she was withdrawing from the representation and would inform the authorities herself. Immediately after withdrawing, the attorney reported the company's conduct to the authorities. 

Is the attorney subject to discipline?

a. Yes, because the information was given to the attorney in confidence and may not be revealed without the client's consent.

b. Yes, unless the company's conduct was criminal.

c. No, because the attorney reasonably believed that the company's disposal of the waste products was likely to cause serious physical harm.

d. No, because the attorney reasonably believed that the president was pursuing an imprudent course of conduct.

### Question 9

Attorney represented Client in a large real estate deal. Buyer, who purchased the real estate from Client, has filed suit against both Client and Attorney, alleging fraud. Attorney had advised Client by letter against making the statements relied upon by Buyer as the basis of Buyer's claim. In her defense to Buyer's suit, Attorney wishes to reveal confidential information imparted to Attorney by Client that will be favorable to Attorney but damaging to Client. 

May Attorney do so?

- What if, unbeknownst to Client, Lawyer had never passed the bar exam and thus was not a licensed attorney?

### Question 12 

You are a public defender representing Jerry Cashwell, who has been charged with murder. Based on witness statements, the police and prosecutor believe that another man, Lee Hunt, planned the murder and that Cashwell acted as Hunt's accomplice in carrying out the killing. To avoid any potential conflict, the court has appointed another lawyer to represent Hunt. 

During your initial meeting with Cashwell, he tells you, "I killed that guy all on my own. Hunt didn't have anything to do with it." Based on the details that Cashwell provides about the crime, and the lack of any apparent motive to falsely claim sole responsibility, you conclude that Cashwell is telling the truth. 

_What are your obligations under Rule 1.6(a)? Do any of the exceptions under Rule 1.6(b) apply at this point?_

Cashwell and Hunt are tried separately. At Hunt's trial, he testifies that he had no role in the crime. Nevertheless, Hunt is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. 

Following Hunt's conviction, you reach an agreement with the prosecution under which Cashwell will plead guilty to the murder charge and receive a life sentence. The prosecutor tells you they are offering this deal, "because we know Cashwell & Hunt acted together". You notify Cashwell of the plea offer and explain to him that, if he goes to trial and it comes out that he acted alone, he would likely face the death penalty. Cashwell accepts the deal and enters a guilty plea. At Cashwell's allocution, he does not reveal that Hunt had no involvement. 

_Do you have any obligation to correct the prosecutor's mistaken belief about Hunt's involvement in the murder? Do you have any obligation to inform the court that Hunt was not involved?_

About ten years later, Cashwell commits suicide in prison. Hunt remains in prison serving his life sentence. 

_Does MRPC Rule 1.6 permit you to reveal Cashwell's admission of sole responsbility to Hunt's attorney now that Cashwell is dead?_ 

_Does NC Rule 8.6 permit or require disclosure?_
