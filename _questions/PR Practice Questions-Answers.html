<h2 id="P2-R2-1" class="C835"><b>1<span class="C840">.</span>The Legal Profession: Bar Admission, History and Diversity</b></h2>
<p class="C162"><b>Question 1a.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>D is correct.</b> Applicants must answer bar application questions fully and truthfully. Question 1 of the character and fitness questionnaire asks for information about conduct within the last five years that would call into question an applicant’s fitness to practice. Henry’s sudden run-up of debt and his absence from work, apparently caused by his disorder, could reflect on his fitness to practice law. The “thorough explanation” of the conduct required by question 1 would require disclosure of the diagnosis.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect. Federal law does prohibit discrimination based on disability, but these questions are limited to asking whether the applicant has an impairment that would restrict his ability to practice or has engaged in conduct that raises a question about his ability to practice. The Department of Justice concluded in 2014 that some mental health questions previously used by bar examiners violate disability laws. But the National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE), which handles the character and fitness review for a majority of states, and the Department of Justice have agreed that the character and fitness questions stated above, which are currently used by the NCBE, do not violate the law.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" id="id_23" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_20_Answers_to_Multiple_Choice_Pract.xhtml#id_24" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="P107">B and C are incorrect because the first of the two bar application questions asks about behavior within the last five years, not about a doctor’s or patient’s subjective beliefs regarding their impact. Therefore Henry must report the condition, even if he or his doctor believes that it will not impact his ability to practice.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 1b.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>B is correct.</b> Josh must reveal the incident and provide any requested details. Minor transgressions in the past are unlikely to derail a bar application but answering a question falsely on a bar application would violate <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_17_Article_8__Maintaining_the_Integ.xhtml#id_84a" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 8.1(a)</a> and could lead to denial of admission or to discipline if the false statement is ever discovered.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect. Although Josh must disclose the incident on his bar application, his obligation is not triggered by his prior dishonesty. He is obliged to disclose because the questionnaire asks for this information. The bar examiners do send a questionnaire to the law school each applicant attended, and this questionnaire might lead the law school to report that Josh reported no disciplinary infractions during college. Josh would be well-advised to reveal the incident to the law school, explaining that he now realized it should have been reported to the school when he applied.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect. As is explained above, <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_17_Article_8__Maintaining_the_Integ.xhtml#id_84" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 8.1</a> imposes a mandatory duty of candor on applicants for admission to the bar. While the other rules in the ethics codes are not binding on law students or on applicants for admission to the bar, <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_17_Article_8__Maintaining_the_Integ.xhtml#id_84" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 8.1</a> is binding on applicants. Therefore, Josh does not have the discretion to decide not to disclose. His subjective judgment that the incident is not relevant to his fitness to practice provides no legitimate basis for non-disclosure. The character and fitness authorities have the responsibility to decide what information might be relevant to determine fitness to practice.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect. The intention of the college as expressed in the expungement of the record is not relevant here. The character and fitness review authorities often ask for criminal and <span id="page_224" class="VST" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 224"><b>224</b></span>other records that have been expunged. Expungement does not protect applicants from the obligation to answer questions fully and honestly.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 1c.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>B is correct.</b> Each state conducts a character and fitness evaluation as part of the bar application process, and the states have broad discretion to deny admission. There have been instances in which individuals were denied bar admission based on failure to pay loans.<sup><a epub:type="noteref" role="doc-noteref" id="id_25" href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_20_Answers_to_Multiple_Choice_Pract.xhtml#id_26" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">2</a></sup> These decisions are arguably misguided or unfair, but they are within the states’ discretion.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect. All lawyers must be financially responsible enough to be trusted with client matters, so Leta could be denied admission even if her intended area of practice was not directly related to finances.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect. It is true that most law students take out loans to pay tuition, and it is arguably true that it is unfair to penalize them for doing so. Even so, a state <em>may</em> deny admission to Leta if it finds, based on these or other facts, that she is unfit to practice law, and an appellate court may sustain that decision.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect for reasons similar to those articulated for C. It is true that every lawyer should aspire to provide pro bono service to clients who cannot afford to pay, and it is true that the profession generally applauds the efforts of those who do full-time service to indigents. Even so, these facts do not preclude a state from denying admission to Leta.</p>

<h2 id="P2-R2-2" class="C835"><b>2<span class="C840">.</span>The Legal Profession: Regulation, Discipline, and Liability</b></h2>
<p class="C162"><b>Question 2a.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>C is correct.</b> The ethics codes in most states attain the force of law after they are adopted by the supreme court in each state. Federal courts also adopt ethics codes for lawyers admitted to practice before them. While most legislative rules are adopted by legislative bodies, the courts have traditionally had the principal responsibility for regulation of lawyers, so the ethics codes are adopted by courts.</p>
<p class="P107">A and D are incorrect. The “negative inherent powers” doctrine once asserted that the courts are the exclusive regulators of lawyers and that legislative bodies have no such authority. This doctrine has been used to strike down some legislation that sought to impose rules on American lawyers. However, this doctrine has long since been rendered obsolete. American lawyers are subject to all sorts of regulatory rules and statutes enacted or adopted by state and federal legislative and administrative bodies. While the courts retain the authority to regulate lawyers, it is incorrect to assert that they have the exclusive authority to do so.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect. The ABA has enormous influence over the regulation of American lawyers, but it is a non-profit organization and has limited regulatory governmental authority. The ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct do not have the force of law and are therefore not binding. Instead, they provide a model used in most states for guidance in drafting ethics codes.</p>
<p class="VST"><span id="page_225" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 225"><b>225</b></span></p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 2b</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>C is correct.</b> State bar associations draft and interpret ethical rules, investigate and prosecute lawyer misconduct and carry out other functions delegated by the highest courts of their states. The Section of Legal Education accredits law schools by virtue of authorization from the U.S. Department of Education.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because the American Law Institute is a non-profit organization that publishes restatements but has no legal authority.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 2c</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>A is correct.</b> Some states have an “integrated bar” in which, to be licensed, a lawyer must belong to the state bar association. Other states have voluntary state bar associations, and a lawyer may be licensed even if he or she does not join the state bar association.</p>
<p class="P107">B, C, and D are therefore incorrect.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 2d.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>A is correct.</b> Under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_17_Article_8__Maintaining_the_Integ.xhtml#id_191" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 8.4(b)</a>, Parnik can be disciplined if the bar authorities find that the stalking raises a question as to his fitness to practice law. Conviction on charges that he committed the act is not a prerequisite to discipline.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect because any lawyer could be disciplined for stalking whether or not the lawyer served as a prosecutor.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because a lawyer can be disciplined for conduct that occurs outside the practice of law.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because a lawyer may be disciplined for conduct even if he was acquitted of charges related to the conduct. The acquittal just means that the charge was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 2e.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>B is correct</b>. The pattern of neglect of and damage to client matters probably raises a substantial question as to Paige’s fitness. When a lawyer knows of conduct that raises such a question, reporting the matter to the disciplinary authorities is mandatory.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect, because Carrie would have a duty to report Paige’s conduct even if Paige had no supervisory authority.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_17_Article_8__Maintaining_the_Integ.xhtml#id_86" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 8.3</a> does not condition the duty to report misconduct on the consent of the clients affected by the misconduct.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because lawyers are required to report misconduct of their partners that raises a substantial question as to those partners’ fitness, and Paige’s conduct can be reported without revealing client confidences.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 2f.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>B is correct.</b> Arthur is committing fraud, which violates <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_17_Article_8__Maintaining_the_Integ.xhtml#id_204" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 8.4(c)</a>. The repeated dishonesty would raise a substantial question as to Arthur’s honesty. Therefore, <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_17_Article_8__Maintaining_the_Integ.xhtml#id_86a" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 8.3(a)</a> requires Grace to report Arthur’s conduct to the appropriate professional authority. Comment 3 identifies the professional authority as the bar disciplinary agency.</p>
<p class="P107">The other answers are incorrect because reporting to the disciplinary authority is mandatory.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because the law firm may not exempt its lawyers from compliance with the duties imposed on each individual lawyer by the ethics code.</p>
<p class="P107">The statements in D may well be accurate, but the question asked about Grace’s obligation under the rules.</p>
<p class="VST"><span id="page_226" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 226"><b>226</b></span></p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 2g.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>C is correct.</b> Zarah is subject to discipline because Rule 5.1(c)(1) states that a lawyer shall be responsible for another lawyer’s misconduct if the lawyer orders the actions. Charlie also is subject to discipline. Under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_14_Article_5__Law_Firms_and_Associa.xhtml#id_199a" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 5.2(b)</a>, a subordinate lawyer does not violate a rule if he acts in accordance with a supervisor’s reasonable resolution of an arguable question of professional duty, but Zarah told Charlie to engage in unambiguously illegal conduct.</p>
<p class="P107">The other answers are therefore not correct.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 2h.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>A is correct.</b> Carson is subject to discipline in state A because <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_17_Article_8__Maintaining_the_Integ.xhtml#id_203" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 8.5 (a)</a> provides that “A lawyer admitted to practice in this jurisdiction is subject to the disciplinary authority of this jurisdiction, regardless of where the lawyer’s conduct occurs.”</p>
<p class="P107">This is the reason why C is incorrect.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect because dishonest conduct renders a lawyer subject to discipline whether or not there is a criminal conviction.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because a disciplinary proceeding based on a criminal offense is not double jeopardy. Instead, its purpose is to protect the state’s interest in ensuring that those practicing law are fit and trustworthy.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 2i.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>B is correct.</b> Each state’s disciplinary system is responsible for policing its membership, and it is proper and common for a lawyer to face discipline in multiple jurisdictions for a single act of misconduct.</p>
<p class="P107">Therefore, C is incorrect.</p>
<p class="P107">A and D are incorrect because the connection of the conduct to the state is not relevant to the propriety of a disciplinary action. <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_17_Article_8__Maintaining_the_Integ.xhtml#id_203" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 8.5(a)</a> states: “A lawyer may be subject to the disciplinary authority of both this jurisdiction and another jurisdiction for the same conduct.” Every state allows discipline for dishonesty, so it does not matter which state’s rules apply.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 2j.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>A is correct.</b> Jabari is subject to discipline in state A for the conduct in state B. <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_17_Article_8__Maintaining_the_Integ.xhtml#rule85b" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 8.5(b)</a> (1) states that in cases involving litigation before a tribunal, the ethical rules that apply are those of the jurisdiction in which the tribunal sits. Therefore, the disciplinary agency in state A would apply the rules in state B in this matter.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect because Jabari’s pro hac vice admission in State B makes him subject to discipline in State B for misconduct there, even though he is also subject to the jurisdiction of the disciplinary authority in State A.</p>
<p class="P107">C and D are incorrect because <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_17_Article_8__Maintaining_the_Integ.xhtml#id_88" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 8.5</a> makes the violation in State B a disciplinary violation in State A.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 2k.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>A is correct.</b> <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_17_Article_8__Maintaining_the_Integ.xhtml#id_86" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 8.3</a> requires reporting the misconduct of a lawyer that raises a substantial question of that lawyer’s honesty, which is clearly the case here. The only exception, contained in Comment 2, is that the report is not required if it would require a violation of <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_36" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.6</a>, which governs protecting client confidences.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect because misconduct is not required to be reported if a report would reveal client confidential information.</p>
<p class="P107">C and D are incorrect because no exception to the reporting requirement exists for a subordinate lawyer who has reported the matter within her firm.</p>
<p class="VST"><span id="page_227" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 227"><b>227</b></span></p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 2l.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>A is correct.</b> An attorney may be disciplined for dishonest conduct even if it occurred out of state and even if it was unconnected with the attorney’s legal work.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect because the disciplinary system need not wait for a complaint to punish a lawyer for misconduct. It could have investigated and punished Mayra without a complaint, if it had read about the misconduct in the press.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because a state may discipline its licensees for misconduct committed elsewhere.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because the settlement did not, and could not, foreclose disciplinary action.</p>

<p class="C162"><b>Question 3a.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>C is correct.</b> Burke may acquire the knowledge he needs to represent a client in an unfamiliar area through necessary study. See <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_32" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.1</a>, <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_242" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Comment 2</a>.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect, because although informing clients about one’s prior lack of experience in handling certain types of cases might be a good practice, no rule requires lawyers to disclose this information to clients.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect, because although co-counseling with an experienced lawyer is one way of providing competent representation, it is not the only acceptable method.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect, because a lawyer might be subject to discipline if he accepted a matter in an unfamiliar area of law and did not “study up” to compensate for his inexperience.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 3b.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>A is correct.</b> Under <em>Togstad v. Vesely, Otto, Miller &amp; Keefe</em>, 291 N.W.2d 686 (Minn. 1980) an attorney-client relationship is formed when an individual seeks and receives legal advice, and a reasonable person would rely on that advice. If an attorney-client relationship existed, the plaintiff need only show that the attorney acted negligently, that such acts were the cause of plaintiff’s damages, and that but for the negligent advice, she would not have suffered damage.</p>
<p class="P107">B is accordingly incorrect.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because consideration is not required for malpractice liability, which could be grounded either in tort or contract.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because the question posits that Carla reasonably believed that Alice was giving legal advice and that the advice was correct. American lawyers are not licensed to provide services only in particular specialties.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 3c.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>C is correct.</b> Even though lawyers are generally required to communicate settlement offers to clients, and clients generally have the authority to accept or reject them under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_107" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.2(a),</a> a client can expressly delegate this authority to her lawyer.

Absent a material change in circumstances and subject to <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_34" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.4</a>, a lawyer may rely on such an advance authorization.” Comment 2 following <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_34" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.4</a> explains that “a lawyer who receives from opposing counsel an offer of settlement in a civil controversy . . . must promptly inform the client of its substance unless the client . . . has authorized the lawyer to accept or to reject the offer.”</p>
<p class="P107">The other answers are accordingly incorrect.</p>

<p class="C160"><b>Question 3d.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>A is correct.</b> Anita’s failure to investigate and advise her client about the immigration consequences of a conviction for her immigrant client is arguably incompetent and therefore Anita could be subject to discipline for violation of <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_32" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.1</a>. Although Liam would have to prove that the advice was prejudicial to have his conviction reversed (in a state in which <em>Padilla</em> was retroactive), the lack of prejudice to a client is not a defense to a disciplinary charge.</p>
<p class="P107">B is accordingly incorrect.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because Anita could be disciplined for incompetence even if no Sixth Amendment remedy is available to Liam.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because a disciplinary body can punish a lawyer for violating the ethical rules whether or not the client is an American citizen.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 3e.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>D is correct.</b> Under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_34" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.4</a>, a lawyer must keep a client informed about the status of a matter. The fact that the client’s case was dismissed is a significant event in the litigation. A lawyer who makes a serious mistake must inform the client (and should inform her malpractice insurer) of her mistake.</p>
<p class="P107">A and B are incorrect for this reason.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect. <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_17_Article_8__Maintaining_the_Integ.xhtml#id_86" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 8.3</a> requires reporting of misconduct by another lawyer but does not require reporting one’s own misconduct.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 3f.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>D is correct.</b> Sylvia will be unable to demonstrate that she suffered any damages.

However, he would not be subject to malpractice liability for his failure to communicate the settlement offer because there are no damages.</p>
<p class="P107">The other answers are accordingly incorrect.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 3g.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>D is correct</b>. The Model Rules do not require a lawyer to reveal to a prospective client that the client might obtain similar services elsewhere for a lower price or the lawyer’s belief that the client might be able to resolve the problem without using legal services at all.</p>
<p class="P107">A and B are accordingly incorrect.</p>

Comment 5 explains that a lawyer practicing in a law firm is impliedly authorized to disclose client confidences to other lawyers within the law firm, but not to lawyers outside the firm.</p>
<p class="P107">A and B are accordingly incorrect. In truly exigent circumstances, a lawyer might be impliedly authorized to enlist the assistance of another lawyer without express client consent. However, in this case, the lawyer has made only a single casual attempt to contact the client.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because, with the permission of Royce, Uma could enlist substitute counsel for the hearing without withdrawing from representation of Royce.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 4b.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>A is correct.</b> <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_172" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.6(b)(5)</a> allows lawyers to reveal confidential information to respond to allegations in a lawsuit by a client concerning the lawyer’s representation of the client. In addition, Comment 16 provides that a lawyer should make efforts to limit disclosure to the parties and the tribunal.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect because under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_90" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.6(a),</a> all information relating to the representation of a client is confidential, regardless of whether the client specifically asks that the information be kept confidential or when the client makes such a request.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_172" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.6(b)(5)</a> allows revelations necessary for a lawyer’s self-defense. A lawyer may reveal confidential information in the circumstances listed in 1.6(b) regardless of a special request for secrecy.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because the ethics code explicitly protects a lawyer’s right to make limited revelations in this situation.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 4c.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>D is correct.</b> Under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_36" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.6</a>, Comment 5, “[l]awyers in a firm may, in the course of the firm’s practice, disclose to each other information relating to a client of the firm, unless the client has instructed that particular information be confined to specified lawyers.” Sandler’s preparation of materials using client information without changing the client’s name, for wide dissemination within the firm, may have been unwise. However, because the rules allow sharing of confidences within a firm, irrespective of the size of the firm, this conduct would not be a basis for discipline. Sandler’s notation on the cover of the materials, stating that they were confidential, took account of <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_171" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.6(c),</a> which requires reasonable efforts to prevent improper disclosure of confidences.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect because sharing information within a firm is not regarded as a “disclosure.”</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect; Nigel’s consent is not required to share information within a law firm.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because a firm is regarded as a single entity even if it has offices in several cities.

<p class="C160"><b>Question 4d.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>C is correct</b>, because no exception to the confidentiality rule (1.6) applies.</p>
<p class="C162">A is incorrect; Alberto and Chad might decide to reveal the information as part of a plea bargain, but Alberto has no discretion to do so without Chad’s authorization.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect because <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_36" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.6</a> does not permit a lawyer to disclose this confidential information even if a criminal investigation is ongoing.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect. Even if Alberto had objective evidence that Chad had killed Ethan, he would not be permitted by <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_36" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.6</a> to reveal this information without Chad’s consent.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 4e.</b></p>

Although the rule permits Jennifer to reveal confidences to obtain advice about her ethical duties, Jennifer would be well-advised not to reveal the client’s identity or other identifying information to consult Isai. Instead she might frame the factual basis of the consultation as a hypothetical.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect.

<p class="P107">C is incorrect because Jennifer is not required to obtain the client’s permission to consult a lawyer outside the firm about her ethical obligations.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because Jennifer may, under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_170" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.6(b)(4),</a> consult any other lawyer for advice about her ethical duties.

<p class="C160"><b>Question 4f.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>D is correct.</b> No exception to the rule against revealing confidences applies.</p>
<p class="P107">A and B are accordingly not correct.</p>
<p class="P107">C is not correct because the fact that Oleg’s son confessed is information relating to the representation, which Moira may not reveal to anyone, even Oleg’s son, without Oleg’s consent.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 4g.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>D is correct</b>.

<p class="P107">A is incorrect. A lawyer may reveal confidential information only when permitted by the rules.

<p class="P107">B is incorrect because even if Blake’s conduct is fraudulent or criminal, a lawyer’s non-disclosure of information protected by <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_36" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.6</a> does not amount to “assisting” a criminal or fraudulent act. None of the exceptions in <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_36" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.6</a> applies, so the duty to protect Blake’s confidences takes precedence over any arguable duty of disclosure.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because no rule requires Mosi to disclose this information to the other patients.</p>

<p class="P107">B is incorrect, because while it is true that her duty continues past the termination of representation, 1.6(b)(6) permits the disclosure in this case.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect, because there is no exception to the confidentiality rule that permits revelation of past criminal conduct.</p>

In this situation, however, as Rona has decided not to buy the apartment, there is no disadvantage to the client. Comment 5 explains that the rule does not prohibit uses of confidential information that do not disadvantage the client.</p>
<p class="P107">C and D are accordingly incorrect.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect because the client’s consent would be required only if there were some disadvantage to the client.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 4j.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>A is correct</b>.

<p class="P107">B is incorrect because <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_134" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.6(b)(1)</a> permits but does not require revelation of confidences “to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary . . . to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm.” The rule imposes no duty to report in such circumstances. The duty to report is imposed by the state statute, and the duty is not predicated on any particular assessment of risk.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because the revelation required by the statute is permitted by <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_135" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.6(b)(6)</a>.</p>

<p class="P107">A is incorrect because even if the injury to Jason’s financial interests was substantial, Salima may not reveal the information unless her services were used to further the crime.</p>

Caroline prepared the contracts, so the client used her services to commit fraud, even though she was unaware at the time that the client was making misrepresentations.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because even if there is no risk of death or substantial bodily harm, a lawyer is permitted to reveal information about fraudulent client conduct that caused or was reasonably certain to cause substantial financial loss and the client used the lawyer’s services to commit the fraud.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 4m.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>C is correct</b>, because the duty to protect confidences learned during the course of the representation continues beyond the termination of the representation, and no exception to the duty to protect confidences applies here.

<p class="P107">A is incorrect for this reason.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect, because although the arson would cause substantial injury to property that could be prevented, Yoshi’s services were not used in furtherance of the arson, so revelation is not permitted under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_148" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.6(b)(2)</a>. Cyrus informed Yoshi of his intention but did not ask for advice about this nor did he enlist Yoshi to assist in any way.</p>

<p class="C160"><b>Question 4n.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>B is correct.</b> The jail identification number is not available to the general public, but jail officials and perhaps police and prosecutors could match the number with the client’s identity. Even if she had omitted the number, these officials or others in the criminal justice system might be able to piece together which of her clients Ella was referring to, and would be able to learn a great deal of private information about Kenneth. Both the jail ID number and her other comments make her revelation improper.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect because although Ella’s statements about her client are highly unprofessional and disloyal, it is not clear that any rule would provide a basis for discipline if she had not revealed confidential information.</p>

<p class="P107">The statements in A are not protected by the attorney-client privilege, because the client was not seeking legal advice when he made the statements.</p>
<p class="P107">The statements in B are not protected by attorney-client privilege because the statements were made by someone other than the client.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because the federal government has been able successfully to subpoena lists of clients who were advised by lawyers to purchase tax shelter investments, where, as here, the advice to purchase the investments was business advice, not legal advice. See <em>United States v. Jenkens &amp; Gilchrist, P.C.</em>, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10710 (N.D. Il. 2005).</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 5b.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>C is correct</b>, because a communication is only protected by the attorney-client privilege if the communication was for the purpose of giving or receiving legal advice or legal services (which it was) and the client reasonably believed the communication was confidential. Here, Benjamin asked his pal Rocky to help him draft the statement. Accordingly, he could not have believed the statement was confidential. The participation of a third person would not result in loss of privilege if the third person was necessary to facilitate the communication. For example, if the client did not speak English, the presence of a translator would not be a problem. In this case, however, there is no indication that Benjamin needed help. He just happened to get it. Since the privilege would be considered to be waived by the participation of a third person, either Benjamin or Rocky could be compelled to testify about its contents.</p>
<p class="P107">The other options are accordingly incorrect.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 5c.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>C is correct.</b> The statement was made by George to Damon in the course of seeking legal advice or services, and no exception to the rule against revealing privileged information applies.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect, because this is precisely the situation in which privilege applies. The information was provided in confidence for the purpose of seeking legal advice so its disclosure should not be compelled.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect, because a lawyer may not be compelled to testify about privileged information, even in an unrelated litigation.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect, because the privilege applies to covered communications regardless of when those communications occur.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 5d.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>C is correct</b>, because opposing counsel is questioning Roland about the underlying facts, not about the statement he made to Salim. The privilege protects only communication between lawyer and client, not the facts discussed by them.</p>
<p class="P107">A is accordingly incorrect.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect, because even if the conversation is protected by attorney-client privilege, the underlying information is not so protected.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because even communications made by a client to his lawyer by e-mail or in any other writing can be covered by attorney-client privilege.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 5e.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>A is correct.</b> This conversation is protected by the attorney-client privilege, because conversations between prospective clients and lawyers are privileged. The other choices are incorrect.</p>
<p class="VST"><span id="page_234" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 234"><b>234</b></span></p>
<p class="P107">The statements in B are not covered by the privilege, because in order for a communication to be privileged, the client must reasonably believe that the communication is confidential.</p>
<p class="P107">The contract in C is not privileged, because the contract is a piece of evidence, not an attorney-client communication.</p>
<p class="P107">The conversation in D is not privileged because the purpose of the conversation was neither to give nor to receive legal advice.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 5f.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>B is correct</b>, because the communication is privileged, and the crime-fraud exception does not apply, because Lilian did not go through with the crime.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect, because not all communications between lawyers and clients are privileged. The crime-fraud exception provides that privilege does not cover communications in which the client asks a lawyer for advice or help in committing a crime or fraud.</p>
<p class="P107">The statement in C is incorrect. The crime-fraud exception does not apply, because Lilian did not ask Tammy for advice in how to commit a crime or fraud. She was seeking advice about how legally to minimize her obligation to pay taxes.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect, because a client’s knowledge about whether certain conduct constitutes a crime or fraud is irrelevant in determining whether a conversation is not protected by privilege because of the crime-fraud exception.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 5g.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>B is correct.</b> <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_36" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.6</a> prohibits lawyers from revealing information relating to the representation of a client. The information is thus confidential. Privilege, on the other hand, only covers communications that the client reasonably believes were made in private between the client and lawyer for the purpose of seeking or delivering legal advice or legal services. As Jaya made these statements in the presence of Josh, she could not reasonably believe they were made in private. They are accordingly not privileged.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 5h.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>C is correct.</b> As in the <em>Upjohn</em> case, 449 U.S. 383 (1981), the lawyer is collecting information for the client so the client can mount a legal defense. It is irrelevant that a different law firm is representing the client in the lawsuit.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect because, while it is true that the facts are not protected from disclosure, the attorneys’ notes, which are a component of its report to its client, are protected.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect, because attorney-client privilege applies to client-lawyer communications whether or not those communications are provided to litigating counsel.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because whether the information requested could result in a client’s liability is not relevant to assessment of the applicability of the attorney-client privilege.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 5i.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>B is correct.</b> Pierre’s presence in the meeting was necessary for Juan to be able to communicate comfortably with Alton. The presence of a third party can cause a conversation between lawyer and client not to be found privileged, but an exception exists when the third party is necessary to the conversation. See Restatement of the Law Governing Lawyers, Sec. 70.</p>
<p class="P107">D is accordingly incorrect.</p>
<p class="P107">A and C are incorrect because it does not matter whether a third party necessary to the communication was suggested or hired by the lawyer or by the client. In fact, payment is completely irrelevant to the privilege claim.</p>
<p class="VST"><span id="page_235" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 235"><b>235</b></span></p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 5j.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>B is correct.</b> As noted by the Supreme Court in <em>Swidler &amp; Berlin v. United States, 524 U.S. 399 (1998)</em>, there is a common law “testamentary” exception to the privilege for disputes among heirs. The court explained that the interest in settling estates outweighs the privilege that would otherwise be accorded to deceased persons who communicated with their attorneys and that revelation in estates cases furthers the effectuation of a deceased client’s intent.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect because the attorney-client privilege belongs to the client and, unless an exception applies, cannot be waived by either next of kin or by the deceased client’s former lawyer.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because the testamentary exception applies.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because the application of the testamentary exception does not depend on the equities of the case.</p>

<p class="C162"><b>Question 6a.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>B is correct.</b> The conflict is a “material limitation” conflict under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_122" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.7(a)(2)</a>. The students’ consent is required because there is a significant risk that Tandy’s representation of them will be materially limited by her obligations to her employer. For example, she might advocate less vigorously on the students’ behalf because the university might terminate her position in reaction to her “biting the hand that feeds her.”</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect because although Tandy may owe some duty of loyalty to the university, the university is not a client, so she is not required by the rules to get the university’s consent.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because the conflict is not between two clients and is not a “direct adversity” conflict. Instead, it is a conflict between the interests of a client and the lawyer’s personal (i.e. employment) interests.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect. The representation of the students would pose a conflict of interest under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_122" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.7(a)(2),</a> but if Tandy reasonably believes that she can represent the students competently and diligently, then the conflict is consentable under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_164" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.7(b)(1)</a>. <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_165" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1.7(b)(2)</a> and <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_166" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">(3)</a> are inapplicable.

<p class="C160"><b>Question 6b.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>B is correct.</b> Spencer is a prospective client under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#page_71" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.18</a> because he has consulted with Kai about the possibility of becoming Kai’s client. Under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_167" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.18(c),</a> Kai may not represent Max because he has received information from Spencer about his unlawful break-in. That information could be used adversely to Spencer if Spencer sues Max.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect because there are conditions under which a lawyer may represent the adversary of someone who first requested the lawyer’s representation; e.g., where the request did not include the transmission of significantly harmful information. In this case, the request did include the request of such information.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because although there is no conflict between two current clients, <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_167" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.18(c)</a> prohibits a lawyer from accepting representation where a lawyer has received information from a prospective client that could be used adversely to that person in the matter.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because Kai is precluded from representing Max because of his obligations to Spencer, who is a prospective client. The legality of Spencer’s conduct is irrelevant.</p>

<p class="C160"><b>Question 6c.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>C is correct.</b> Under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_37" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.10</a>, when lawyers are associated in a firm, “none of them may represent a client when one of them practicing alone would be prohibited from doing so by <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#page_29" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rules 1.7</a> or 1.9 . . . .” Therefore, one must ask whether one of these lawyers could reasonably believe that he could competently and diligently represent both clients. If the conflict is consentable under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_164" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1.7(b)(1)</a> and if both clients give informed consent, then Charlie may proceed. This is unlikely on these facts, since the firm is representing Todd in a divorce suit against Suma, but might be possible if the divorce is amicable.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect. <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_126" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.10(a)(2)</a> allows screening in limited circumstances that are not applicable here.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect because this conflict is not “based on a personal interest of the disqualified lawyer” and therefore the language of 1.10(a)(1) has no application here. If, instead of representing Suma in a wrongful discharge case, Charlie was involved in a romance with Suma, then <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#page_49" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.10(a)(1)</a> would allow the firm to represent Todd despite Charlie’s personal interest conflict with the divorce case.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because a law firm may sue a current client if the conditions stated in 1.7(b)(1) are satisfied.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 6d.</b></p>
<p class="C162">This question asks simply whether there is a conflict of interest. This is the question addressed by <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_121" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.7(a)</a>. If there is a conflict, one would need to evaluate it using 1.7(b) to see if the lawyer could continue to represent these clients despite the conflict. This question does not require that analysis.</p>
<p class="P107"><b>A is correct.</b> Pavel must cross-examine Betty in order to represent Denny competently and diligently. This situation presents direct adversity between the two clients. Comment 6 after <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#page_29" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.7</a> explains “a directly adverse conflict may arise when a lawyer is required to cross-examine a client who appears as a witness in a lawsuit involving another client, as when the testimony will be damaging to the client who is represented in the lawsuit.” Betty’s testimony may exculpate Denny and inculpate Betty. After the cross-examination, Denny might be acquitted on the charge and Betty indicted. Even if she is not charged with the jewelry theft, the cross-examination could negatively impact her credibility and her potential liability on the arson charge. This is not the same impact as the example in the comment, but, as in the example, the cross-examination could harm a current client.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect because it is irrelevant whether the clients are paying for the attorney’s services.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because there can be direct adversity even if neither party is asserting a claim against the other.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect. Even if competent representation of Denny would require the cross-examination of Betty and is therefore impliedly authorized, Pavel may have to withdraw because of the conflict.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 6e.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>B is correct.</b> <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#page_71" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.18</a> specifies the circumstances under which a lawyer owes duties to a prospective client. Ordinarily, a person who consults with a lawyer about the possibility of forming a lawyer-client relationship is a prospective client, and, under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_167" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.18(c),</a> a lawyer may not “represent a client with interests materially adverse to those of a prospective client in the same or a substantially related matter if the lawyer received information from the prospective client that could be significantly harmful to that person in the matter.” At first glance, it would appear that Roger may not represent Reva. However, comment 2 following <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#page_71" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.18</a> provides that a person who communicates with a lawyer for the purpose <span id="page_237" class="VST" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 237"><b>237</b></span>of disqualifying the lawyer is not considered a prospective client. Therefore, Roger owes no duty to Leon. Comment 2 takes this case out from under the restrictions of <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#page_71" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.18</a>.</p>
<p class="P107">A and C are accordingly incorrect.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect. If Leon were a prospective client, and the conflict was consentable, informed consent would be needed from both Leon and Reva. But, as explained above, Leon is not a prospective client because his consultation was not in good faith but instead was an effort to preclude Roger from representing Reva.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 6f.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>D is correct.</b> Laurel would be representing one client in one suit against another client whom she represents in a different matter. A lawyer may sue a current client on behalf of another client only if the lawyer reasonably believes that she can represent both clients competently and diligently, and if both clients give informed consent, confirmed in writing. Meghan does not reasonably believe that she could competently and diligently sue Walter on behalf of Laurel while simultaneously representing him on the criminal charge.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect. The representation of Laurel in a suit against Walter would involve “direct adversity” under 1.7(a)(1). Even if the representation is not prohibited by law, the conflict is not consentable for the reasons explained above.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect because in analyzing concurrent conflicts, the subject matters of the cases are irrelevant.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because Meghan is not representing both clients in the same litigation. <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_166" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.7(b)(3)</a> does not apply to these facts because Meghan is representing Walter in one matter and is considering representing Laurel in a different matter. <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_166" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.7(b)(3)</a> would apply here if Meghan represented both Laurel and Walter in Laurel’s case.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 6g.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>C is correct.</b> A positional conflict such as the one described here can present a conflict of interest under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_122" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.7(a)(2)</a>. Comment 24 following <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#page_29" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.7</a> explains:</p>
<p class="P116">The mere fact that advocating a legal position on behalf of one client might create precedent adverse to the interests of a client represented by the lawyer in an unrelated matter does not create a conflict of interest. A conflict of interest exists, however, if there is a significant risk that a lawyer’s action on behalf of one client will materially limit the lawyer’s effectiveness in representing another client in a different case; for example, when a decision favoring one client will create a precedent likely to seriously weaken the position taken on behalf of the other client. Factors relevant in determining whether the clients need to be advised of the risk include: where the cases are pending, whether the issue is substantive or procedural, the temporal relationship between the matters, the significance of the issue to the immediate and long-term interests of the clients involved and the clients’ reasonable expectations in retaining the lawyer. If there is significant risk of material limitation, then absent informed consent of the affected clients, the lawyer must refuse one of the representations or withdraw from one or both matters.</p>
<p class="C160">Restatement section 128, comment f, identifies a similar list of factors. The factor not included in either list is whether the lawyer is representing the client without charging a fee.</p>
<p class="P107">The factors identified in answers A, B, and D are among those listed as relevant in determining whether there is a conflict that requires client consent.</p>

But Martha reasonably believes that she can provide competent and diligent representation to both, thus satisfying the requirement of <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_164" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.7(b)(1),</a> and both affected clients have given informed consent, confirmed in writing. The writing need not have originated with the clients. Nothing in these facts suggests that the representation is prohibited by law or that either client will make a claim against the other. Therefore, all of the requirements of <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_91" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.7(b)</a> are met, and the representation may be undertaken.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect because both parties must give informed consent.</p>
<p class="P107">C and D are incorrect because <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#page_29" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.7</a> expressly allows conflicts to be waived under these conditions.</p>

<h2 id="P2-R2-7" class="C835"><b>7<span class="C840">.</span>Conflicts Involving Former Clients</b></h2>
<p class="C162"><b>Question 7a.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>A is correct.</b> The prior representation was of Matthew as an individual in a matter that would not have involved “a substantial risk that confidential factual information as would normally have been obtained in the prior representation would materially advance the client’s position in a subsequent matter.” See <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#page_46" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.9</a>, comment 3. This is evident because the prior representation was not of Sharky, but of one of its officers, and the representation did not involve financial information about the corporation.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect because the length of time a lawyer worked on a case is not relevant to the conflicts analysis. If the matters are substantially related and there is material adversity, the former client’s consent may be required.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect. Carlos’ former client is Matthew, not Berry’s. The work on behalf of Sharky is adverse to Berry’s, not to Matthew. Even if the new matter were materially adverse to Berry’s, Carlos could continue the representation without the consent of the former client unless the new matter also was the same as or substantially related to the prior matter, which is not the case here.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because Carlos’ former client is Matthew, not Berry’s. Even though Matthew owns Berry’s, Inc., prior representation of an officer of a corporation in a personal matter does not create a conflict for a lawyer seeking to sue the corporation on a business matter unless the two matters are substantially related, as explained in comment 3 to <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#page_46" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.9</a>.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 7b.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>C is correct.</b> Because Sally is Mira’s former client, <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#page_46" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.9</a> applies. Under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_92" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.9(a),</a> an attorney must obtain a former client’s informed consent only if she plans to represent <span id="page_239" class="VST" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 239"><b>239</b></span>another person in the “same or a substantially related matter in which that person’s interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former client.” The question of substantial relationship is whether there is a substantial risk that Mira would normally have learned confidential information in her former representation of Sally that would materially advance Jose’s position in the new matter. If Jose were seeking damages, Mira might have knowledge of Sally’s financial situation that might be used adversely to Sally. However, since Jose is only seeking an injunction, it is unlikely that any prior confidences could be used adversely. Therefore there probably is not a substantial relationship between the prior matter and the current one, so no consent is required.</p>
<p class="P107">A is accordingly incorrect.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect. For an explanation of the application of the standard articulated in <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_122" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.7(a)(2),</a> which is referenced in B, see the discussion following question 8c.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because Jose’s interests are in fact materially adverse to Sally’s.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 7c.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>B is correct.</b> Because Jose would become Mira’s new client, <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#page_29" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.7</a> applies. Under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_122" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.7(a)(2),</a> a lawyer must obtain the consent of a prospective client if “there is a significant risk that the representation of [that client] will be materially limited by the lawyer’s responsibilities to . . . a former client.” Mira and Sally had a professional relationship and have had continuing social contact, so it is possible that Mira would be less vigorous in her advocacy on behalf of Jose because of her relationship to Sally.</p>
<p class="P107">A is not correct. Although Jose’s interests are directly adverse to Sally’s, Sally is not a current client, and 1.7(a)(1) refers to direct adversity between two current clients.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because it is irrelevant that the lawsuits are unrelated if Mira’s loyalty to Sally will materially limit her representation of Jose.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because Jose’s interests are materially adverse to Sally’s.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 7d.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>D is correct.</b> Under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_92" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.9(a),</a> Shawn may not represent Evelyn in drafting the new will. Adelaide is a former client of Shawn’s. The new matter is the same matter as the one on which he previously represented Adelaide, and Evelyn’s interests are materially adverse to Adelaide’s, so his revising the will is prohibited unless Adelaide gives informed consent. To obtain Adelaide’s consent, Shawn needs to reveal confidential information to her about her mother’s intentions as to the will. Shawn may not do this unless Evelyn consents to the revelation of those confidences, which she will not.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect because Adelaide is a former client of Shawn’s. The rules do not distinguish among former clients based on the degree of the lawyer’s involvement in their representation.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect. Although Shawn owes a duty to Evelyn to protect confidences, Adelaide is a former client, so Shawn may not undertake related representation adverse to her without obtaining her informed consent.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because whether Adelaide is considered a current or former client, Shawn still owes her a duty not to undertake representation adverse to her without her informed consent.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 7e.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>B is correct.</b> 1.9(b) applies rather than 1.9(a) because Kieran himself did not represent Roxbury; it was a client of his former firm. <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_124" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.9(b)</a> would bar Kieran from working on this matter unless Roxbury gave informed consent because (1) the matters are the same or <span id="page_240" class="VST" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 240"><b>240</b></span>substantially related, (2) the interests of the parties are materially adverse, and (3) Kieran knows confidential information about the former matter that is material to the new matter.</p>
<p class="P107">However, the firm can undertake work on this matter without Roxbury’s consent if the screening procedures specified in that rule are implemented. <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_37" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.10</a> precludes a lawyer in the new firm from handling a matter if another lawyer in the firm would be precluded from doing so, unless the preclusion is based on <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_92" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.9(a)</a> or <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_124" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">(b)</a> and arises out of the disqualified lawyer’s association with a prior firm (both are true in this case). In that instance, the conflict is not imputed to other lawyers in the firm if the firm complies with the screening procedures specified in <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_126" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.10(a)(2)</a>. Therefore, the Perlmutter firm may go forward only if Kieran does not work on the matter and receives no part of the fee from it, and the firm implements all of the screening procedures required by <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_126" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.10(a)(2)</a>.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect because the nature of Kieran and Lance’s relationship is irrelevant to the analysis.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because “substantial relationship” between the two matters does not preclude the firm from going forward so long as it implements the screening procedures listed in <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_126" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.10(a)(2)</a>.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect. The firm could in fact avoid the potential conflict by firing Kieran, but it need not do so. Instead, it can screen him from contact with the lawyers working on the new matter, as discussed in the answer to B.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 7f.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>B is correct.</b> Barry moved from one law firm to another. His former firm represented Panko in a similar matter. This situation is therefore governed by <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_124" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.9(b),</a> not <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_92" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1.9(a)</a>. Under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_124" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.9(b):</a></p>
<p class="P116">A lawyer shall not knowingly represent a person in the same or a substantially related matter in which a firm with which the lawyer formerly was associated had previously represented a client (1) whose interests are materially adverse to that person; and (2) about whom the lawyer had acquired information protected by <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_36" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rules 1.6</a> and <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_92" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">1.9(c)</a> that is material to the matter.</p>
<p class="C162">A is incorrect because even though the two matters are substantially related, Barry is not precluded from representing Panko, Inc. under 1.9(b)(2) because he did not actually acquire confidential information about the prior matter.</p>
<p class="P107">C and D are incorrect because even though Ted’s interests <em>are</em> materially adverse to Panko’s, and even though the matters <em>are</em> substantially related, <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_124" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.9(b)</a> requires the consent of the former client here only if there is substantial relationship and material adversity, <em>and</em> the lawyer actually received confidential information about the prior matter that is material to the new case.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 7g.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>D is correct.</b> Under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#page_46" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.9</a> a former client’s lawyer may not represent a person in a substantially related matter in which the new client’s interests are adverse to the former client’s interests, unless the former client consents. At first blush, the two representations appear to have nothing to do with each other. But according to comment 3, a matter is “substantially related” if there is “a substantial risk that confidential factual information as would normally have been obtained in the prior representation would materially advance the new client’s position in the subsequent matter.” Armand would normally have learned a great deal about the extent and location of Walter’s assets during the divorce proceedings. It would <span id="page_241" class="VST" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 241"><b>241</b></span>benefit Celia to have ready access to that information, especially because, in a punitive damages case, the recovery could well exceed the amount of Walter’s malpractice insurance.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect for this reason.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect, because the test is what information Armand normally would have obtained in the prior representation, not what he actually knows now.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because a lawyer may sue a former client without consent if the former representation and the new representation involve neither the same matter nor a substantially related matter.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 7h.</b></p>
<p class="P107"><b>B is correct.</b> Sprinkles is Ash’s former client. Under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_92" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.9(a),</a> Ash need only obtain Sprinkles’ informed consent if the two matters are the same or substantially related <span class="Underline">and</span> if DBC’s interests are materially adverse to Sprinkles’. The matters would be substantially related if, in the course of representing Sprinkles, a there is a substantial risk that confidential information that a lawyer ordinarily would have learned in the prior representation would materially advance DBC’s position in the new representation. Because Ash handled only a routine license application at the inception of Sprinkles’ business, Ash would not have learned confidences that would advance DBC’s position in the new representation. Because the two matters are not substantially related, Ash need not obtain informed consent.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect because the fact that a prospective client and former client are economic competitors would not exempt an attorney from the mandates of <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#page_46" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.9</a>.</p>
<p class="P107">C is not correct because attorneys may accept cases involving economic competitors if they otherwise comply with the conflicts rules.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because even if there is material adversity here, there is no substantial relationship. <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#page_46" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.9</a> requires informed consent only if the parties’ interests are materially adverse and the two matters are substantially related.</p>

<section aria-labelledby="P2-R2-8">
<h2 id="P2-R2-8" class="C835"><b>8<span class="C840">.</span>Conflicts Issues in Particular Practice Settings</b></h2>
<p class="C162"><b>Question 8a.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>D is correct.</b> Comment 25 after <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#page_29" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.7</a> explains:</p>
<p class="P116">When a lawyer represents or seeks to represent a class of plaintiffs or defendants in a class-action lawsuit, unnamed members of the class are ordinarily not considered to be clients of the lawyer for purposes of applying paragraph (a)(1) of this Rule. <em>Thus, the lawyer does not typically need to get the consent of such a person before representing a client suing the person in an unrelated matter.</em> . . . (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="C162">Accordingly, answers A, B and C are incorrect.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 8b.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>D is correct.</b> Joint representation of criminal co-defendants always presents a risk that representation of one client will be materially limited by the lawyer’s responsibilities to the other client (for example, if the prosecutor offers one of them a deal if he testifies against the other). Virtually all authorities recommend against such representation. See, e.g. ABA, Criminal Justice Standards: Defense Function, Standard 4-3.5(c). In this instance, either defendant might get a better deal by testifying against the other, producing a genuine <span id="page_242" class="VST" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 242"><b>242</b></span>conflict. In particular, Bobby could benefit by confirming that Chris was the instigator and testifying or offering to testify against him.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect because the conflict is not consentable; Meyer could not reasonably believe, under these circumstances, that he could provide diligent representation to both co-defendants. Bobby might obtain a lesser penalty by giving evidence against Chris; he arguably needs independent advice to assess his options.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect because, while it might seem more efficient for a single lawyer to investigate one set of facts, the situation presents the possibility that it will be in the interest of each client to inculpate the other. Therefore, this situation presents a conflict under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_122" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.7(a)(2)</a> that is not remediable under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_164" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.7(b)(1)</a>.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because if the standards of <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_164" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.7(b)(1)</a> are met (not the case here), a lawyer need not obtain judicial permission before engaging in representation of co-defendants.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 8c.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>B is correct.</b> Morton’s prior relationship with Carl and the somewhat divergent interests of the siblings may create an actual or potential conflict under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_122" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.7(a)(2)</a> (material limitation). If so, Morton may not undertake this representation without the informed consent of each of the three siblings. Comment 18 after <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#page_29" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.7</a> states: “When representation of multiple clients on a single matter is undertaken, the information must include the implications of the common representation, including possible effects on loyalty, confidentiality and the attorney client privilege and the advantages and risks involved.” However, if the three give consent after being fully informed, Morton may represent all three because, per Comment 28 to <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#page_29" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.7</a>, the siblings’ interests are not “fundamentally antagonistic to each other” but are “generally aligned in interest even though there is some divergence in interest among them.”</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect because a lawyer undertaking joint representation should not avoid the conflict by acting as a “mere scrivener” recording the clients’ intentions, but should seek to provide each of the clients with the same range of advice as he would if he were to represent any one of them. Restatement section 130, comment b.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect. If the siblings disagreed as to the valuation of the property, their interests might be fundamentally antagonistic. However, the sisters value preserving their good relationship with their brother and are willing to make some financial sacrifice to achieve this goal. Since the siblings agree on the most important feature of the transaction, the conflict is consentable.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect. As explained above as to option B, there is a conflict under 1.7(a)(2), but the conflict is not so serious that Morton could not reasonably believe that he could “provide competent and diligent representation to each affected client,” (1.7(b)(1)), so the siblings may waive the conflict after being fully informed.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 8d.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>C is correct.</b> Comment 31 following <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#page_29" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.7</a> states that “continued common representation will almost certainly be inadequate if one client asks the lawyer not to disclose to the other client information relevant to the common representation.” Morton owes an “equal duty of loyalty to each client, and each client has the right to be informed of anything bearing on the representation that might affect that client’s interests and the right to expect that the lawyer will use that information to that client’s benefit.” Comment 31 following <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#page_29" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.7</a>.</p>
<p class="P107">A and B are incorrect. Morton may not withhold information from the sisters even if he believes that the benefits to Carl would be greater than the harm to the sisters from delay. See the discussion above.</p>
<p class="VST"><span id="page_243" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 243"><b>243</b></span></p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect. Morton should decline Carl’s suggestion and proceed diligently with the transaction. He is not required to withdraw simply because Carl asked if Morton could secretly act for his benefit alone. So long as Morton does not participate in a crime or fraud or counsel a client to do so, he may continue the representation.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 8e.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>C is best</b>. Comment 10 following <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_40" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.13</a> states:</p>
<p class="P116">There are times when the organization’s interest may be or become adverse to those of one or more of its constituents. In such circumstances the lawyer should advise any constituent, whose interest the lawyer finds adverse to that of the organization of the conflict or potential conflict of interest, that the lawyer cannot represent such constituent, and that such person may wish to obtain independent representation. Care must be taken to assure that the individual understands that, when there is such adversity of interest, the lawyer for the organization cannot provide legal representation for that constituent individual, and that discussions between the lawyer for the organization and the individual may not be privileged.</p>
<p class="C162">Rule 4.3 offers similar guidance for any lawyer in dealing with an unrepresented person.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect because, while the conversation may be privileged, the privilege, if any, belongs to Plenum, not to Bertha, since Plenum is the client. Bertha cannot speak to Jaiden in confidence without fear of Jaiden revealing the contents of the conversation to others in the corporation.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect. <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_163" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.13(g)</a> states that “A lawyer representing an organization may also represent any of its . . . employees . . . subject to the provisions of <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#page_29" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.7</a>.”</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect. Jaiden does have a duty to his client Plenum to protect as confidential information relating to the representation, including the contents of this conversation, but under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_113" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.13(c),</a> the lawyer may reveal confidential information relating to the representation of an organization outside of the organization. Jaiden may reveal Bertha’s information to government officials if the conditions listed in <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_113" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.13(c)</a> are satisfied. If he reports Bertha’s misfeasance to the highest authority at Plenum, Plenum fails to take action to rectify unlawful conduct, Jaiden “reasonably believes that the violation is reasonably certain to result in substantial injury to the organization,” and the revelation is necessary to prevent this injury, then he may report the information outside of the corporation. Therefore, it is not accurate to describe his duty to protect confidences as absolute.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 8f.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>A is correct.</b> In the absence of an actual or apparent conflict, a lawyer may serve on the board of a corporation that the lawyer represents. See <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#page_29" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.7</a>, Comment 35. The lawyer may also own stock in the corporation. The lawyer should be aware that communications with corporate employees may not be covered by attorney-client privilege, and the lawyer should recuse himself or herself, or resign from the board, if a conflict should arise. (For example, if the lawyer is asked for a legal opinion about the validity of bonuses being paid to board members including the lawyer, he should recuse himself.)</p>
<p class="P107">C and D are accordingly incorrect.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect because no law bars an attorney from being recruited to join a board because of friendship with a member.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 8g.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>C is correct.</b> Rule 1.13 (c)(2) provides that when the lawyer for a corporation reasonably believes that a violation is reasonably certain to result in substantial injury to the corporation <span id="page_244" class="VST" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 244"><b>244</b></span>she represents, and the highest authority that can act for the corporation fails to address the situation, the lawyer “may” reveal the information to prevent the injury to the corporation, but it does not require her to do so.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect because harm to the public is not a sufficient basis for a lawyer’s violation of <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_36" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.6</a>, unless the harm rises to the level of one of the exceptions in <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_133" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.6(b)</a> or elsewhere in the rules.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect because <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_40" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.13</a> requires “reporting up” to higher levels within the corporation but only <em>permits</em> “reporting out,” rather than <em>requiring</em> it.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_40" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.13</a> does not require disclosure.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 8h.</b></p>

The lawyer is not <em>required</em> to withdraw for any of these reasons.</p>
<p class="P107">A and B are therefore incorrect.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because she would not be <em>required</em> to withdraw even if she represented Marcus.</p>

<p class="C162"><b>Question 9a.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>B is correct.</b> Under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_147" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.5(b),</a> a lawyer must communicate to the client “the basis or rate of the fee <em>and expenses</em> for which the client will be responsible” within a reasonable time after commencing representation (emphasis added). Lucille billed Basia for Magda’s services, even though she had not informed her that she would do so.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect because the rule merely states that it is “preferable” for the communication about fees to be in writing, and the rule does not require a lawyer to give an estimate of the total fee.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because although the lawyer’s rate need not be communicated in writing, the lawyer must inform the client “whether and to what extent the client will be responsible for any costs, expenses or disbursements,” such as the cost to hire an interpreter.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because after the bail emergency was over, Lucille did not communicate the expected expenses for which Basia would be responsible.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 9b.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>C is correct.</b> <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_152" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.5(c)</a> requires any contingent fee agreement to be in a writing signed by a client.</p>
<p class="P107">A and B are accordingly incorrect.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect. Contingent fee rates of 33 percent are not unusual. Some scholars assert that if a lawyer works only a few hours, it is unreasonable for a lawyer to receive as much as one third of a settlement. However, this rate remains commonplace.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 9c.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>A is correct.</b> Under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_156" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.8(e),</a> “[a] lawyer shall not provide financial assistance to a client in connection with pending or contemplated litigation, except that . . . a lawyer may advance court costs and expenses of litigation, the repayment of which may be contingent <span id="page_245" class="VST" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 245"><b>245</b></span>on the outcome of the matter.” Joseph had told Cyrus that he wanted to appeal, so Cyrus was authorized to act without further consent from Joseph.

<p class="P107">B is not correct, because this is not a situation in which a contingency fee is prohibited.</p>
<p class="P107">C is not correct. <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_161" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.8(d)</a> states: “Prior to the conclusion of representation of a client, a lawyer shall not make or negotiate an agreement giving the lawyer literary or media rights to a portrayal or account based in substantial part on information relating to the representation.” Here, the representation concerns a landlord-tenant dispute, which has nothing to do with the content of the book. <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_161" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.8(d),</a> therefore, has no application here.</p>
<p class="P107">D is also incorrect for that reason. If 1.8(d) applied, it would prohibit the negotiation of an arrangement to share royalties until after the representation was completed.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 9e.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>D is correct.</b> Under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_160" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.8(h)(1),</a> “[a] lawyer shall not make an agreement prospectively limiting the lawyer’s liability to a client for malpractice unless the client is independently represented in making the agreement.” It does not matter that Morgan advised Barbara to consult another lawyer; Barbara must actually be represented by another lawyer in making the agreement.</p>
<p class="P107">The other answers are accordingly wrong.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 9f.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>B is correct.</b> Under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_159" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.8(h)(2),</a> “[a] lawyer shall not . . . settle a claim or potential claim for such liability with an unrepresented client or former client unless that person is advised in writing of the desirability of seeking and is given a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent legal counsel in connection therewith.” Here, Barbara need not actually be represented by another lawyer; Morgan need only advise her of the desirability of seeking outside counsel.</p>
<p class="P107">C is accordingly not correct.</p>
<p class="P107">A is not correct, because a settlement may be considered reasonable even if the settlement amount is less than the damages. Here the settlement amount was more than the damages.</p>
<p class="P107">D is not correct, because while a malpractice insurance contract may require a lawyer to notify the carrier of mistakes that could result in liability, the ethics code includes no such requirement.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 9g.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>B is correct.</b> Under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_158" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.8(c),</a> “[a] lawyer shall not solicit any substantial gift from a client, including a testamentary gift, or prepare on behalf of a client an instrument giving <span id="page_246" class="VST" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 246"><b>246</b></span>the lawyer or a person related to the lawyer any substantial gift unless the lawyer or other recipient of the gift is related to the client.” In this matter, Eli did not solicit the gift nor did he prepare the gift instrument.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect. There are restrictions, but this matter does not implicate those restrictions, as explained above.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect, because the rules do not require a guardian ad litem to be appointed in this situation.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect, because the rule only prohibits a lawyer from “soliciting” a substantial gift from the client; here, there is no indication that Eli solicited the gift. If the gift is unsolicited, it can be accepted even if its value is large.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 9h.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>B is correct.</b> Under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_42" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.15</a>, Sebastian must keep his own funds separate from the property of clients. Until he has done the work, the $4,000 that he receives from each client is still property of the client. Accordingly, Sebastian needs one additional account: a trust account for client property. The other answers are not correct, because each client’s property need not be kept separate from the other clients’ property, though the lawyer must keep complete records of the account.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 9i.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>B is correct.</b> Under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_152" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.5(c),</a> a lawyer may enter into a contingent fee arrangement with a client, as long as the client gives consent in a signed writing.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect, because <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_157" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.5(d)(1)</a> only prohibits charging a fee that is “contingent upon the securing of a divorce or upon the amount of alimony or support, or property settlement in lieu thereof.” Here, Maria is not helping Jillian secure a divorce or an order for support; she is merely seeking to enforce a child support order.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect. The rules on consent for contingent fees are the same for new and former clients.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect, because 30 percent is often considered a reasonable percentage. The rules do not make distinctions among types of cases, except that contingent fees in family law cases are prohibited as described in the answer to C, and in the representation of criminal defendants.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 9j.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>A is correct.</b> <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_147" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.5(b)</a> requires “the basis or rate of the fee and expenses for which the client will be responsible” to be disclosed to the client.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect because <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_147" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.5(b)</a> only states that the basis or rate should be disclosed “preferably in writing;” a written instrument is not required.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_35" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.5</a> does not require an estimate of the total fee.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_144" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.5(a)</a> only requires that legal fees be reasonable. One factor in determining reasonableness is “the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services.” Donna’s fee is not unusual in the locality; she need not charge less than all the other lawyers in the community.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 9k.</b></p>

<p class="P107">A is incorrect because referral fees are prohibited whether disclosed to the client or not.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because the payment of referral fees is prohibited even if the referrer has no conflict of interest.</p>
<p class="VST"><span id="page_247" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 247"><b>247</b></span></p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because even if he pays Joan only ten percent of his fee, he would be sharing his legal fee with a non-lawyer.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 9l.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>B is correct.</b> <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_156" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.8(e)</a> only bars financial assistance to clients “in connection with pending or contemplated litigation.” Comment 10 says “Lawyers may not subsidize lawsuits or administrative proceedings brought on behalf of their clients.” The lawyer in this example is assisting the client in applying for food stamps. She is not engaging in litigation. An application for emergency food stamps is not an “administrative proceeding” because, although it is an application to an administrative agency, it is not a “proceeding” which would be decided by an administrative law judge.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect as the lawyer is charging a fee, albeit a small one. <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_155" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.8(e)(3)</a> allows lawyers to give indigent clients modest gifts for food, rent, transportation, medicine and other basic living expenses, but only if the lawyer is representing the client pro bono.</p>
<p class="P107">C and D are incorrect because <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_156" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.8(e)</a> does not prohibit the lawyer from providing financial assistance to the client in this situation. Also, there is no apparent conflict of interest. There is no need for the lawyer to terminate the representation before she gives the client the money.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 9m.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>B is correct.</b> <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_156" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.8(e)</a> prohibits lawyers from providing financial assistance to clients in connection with pending or contemplated litigation except for court costs and expenses of litigation. Geraldine is suing Mike’s Counseling Service on behalf of Amber. Any financial support of Amber during this time would be considered to be “in connection with litigation.” However, <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_155" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.8(e)(3)</a> allows a lawyer who is representing a client pro bono to “provide modest gifts to the client for food, rent, transportation, medicine and other basic living expenses.” Under this rule, the lawyer in this problem may give the client money to rent a modest room. Accordingly, B is correct, and D is incorrect. <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_154" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.8(e)(3)(ii)</a> goes on to state that the lawyer may not seek reimbursement of the gift from the client or a relative of the client. The lawyer accordingly cannot loan the money to the client, and A and C are therefore incorrect.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 9n.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>C is correct.</b> <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_153" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.5(d)</a> states that “A lawyer shall not enter into an arrangement for, charge, or collect: (1) any fee in a domestic relations matter, the payment or amount of which is contingent upon the securing of a divorce or upon the amount of alimony or support, or property settlement in lieu thereof.” A contingent fee is not permitted in this case because the action is a petition for child support. The support order has not yet been issued, so the amount has not yet been determined. The rule seeks to ensure that the amount of awards in domestic relations matters will not be inflated by lawyers’ desire for a larger fees.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect. <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_153" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.5(d)</a> prohibits a lawyer from charging a contingent fee for representing a defendant in a criminal case. This proposed suit, however, is an action for damages in a civil case.</p>

<p class="C160"><b>Question 9o.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>A is correct.</b> This arrangement would comply with <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#page_21" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.5(e)</a> on division of fees between lawyers not in the same firm, but the lawyers also must comply with <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_152" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.5(c)</a> because this is a contingent fee agreement.

<p class="P107">C and D are incorrect because under 1.5(e)(1), the two lawyers may share the fee if the lawyers assume joint responsibility for the work performed. Comment 7 after <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_35" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.5</a> says “Joint responsibility for the representation entails financial and ethical responsibility for the representation as if the lawyers were associated in a partnership.” Sol’s area of expertise is not relevant. Who does how much of the actual work doesn’t matter either under 1.5(e), provided that they assume joint responsibility for the representation.</p>
<p class="P107">B is accordingly incorrect.</p>

The comment should be understood to mean that an arbitration clause is not a limitation on malpractice liability, and therefore the lawyer need not even advise the client of the desirability of seeking independent legal advice before signing it.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect because a lawyer may ask a client to agree to a clause requiring arbitration of any malpractice claims without the client being independently represented.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect because a lawyer need not advise the client of the desirability of seeking independent counsel before entering into such an agreement.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect; the comment makes no mention of contingent fee cases.</p>

<p class="P107">D is incorrect because the dishonesty need not be adjudicated in a lawsuit prior to discipline.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 9r.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>A is correct.</b> A lawyer may not use money from a client trust account for her own purposes, even for humanitarian reasons.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect because for a lawyer to borrow money from a client would require that the lawyer comply with the requirements of <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_93" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.8(a),</a> including getting the client’s informed consent in advance of the transaction, which she has not done.

<p class="P107">C is incorrect. Actual harm to the client is not relevant in determining disciplinary liability.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect.

It is used instead of <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_92" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.9(a)</a>. Former government lawyers in private practice, then, would look at <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_150" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.11(a)</a> to assess the impact of a conflict on a former government client, and (as Comment 1 makes clear) would look at <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#page_29" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.7</a>, as usual, to assess the impact of that conflict on any present client. This is the reason why A is incorrect.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_150" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.11(a)</a> explicitly provides that former government lawyers are subject to <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_116" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.9(c)</a>.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 10b.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>D is correct.</b> 18 U.S.C. Sec. 205(a)(1) imposes criminal penalties on any officer or agent of the United States who acts as an attorney for prosecuting any claim against the United States, even if the employee works in a different part of the government. The other answers are incorrect because this law does not provide for waiver either by the United States or by a private client.</p>
<p class="P107">The other answers are incorrect for this reason.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 10c.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>B is correct.</b> Under 1.11(a), Dania’s personal and substantial participation in the matter disqualifies her from working on it. Other lawyers in the firm may work on this matter if the firm notifies the SEC, erects a timely screen, and apportions no part of the fee from that work to Dania. Dania’s work focused on defendants in the case who are not clients of the firm; nevertheless, the firm’s work would probably be considered the same matter as the one in which Dania personally and substantially participated. Comment 10 after <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_38" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.11</a> says “In determining whether two particular matters are the same, the lawyer should consider the extent to which the matters involve the same basic facts, the same or related parties, and the time elapsed.” This is obviously the “same matter” as the one Dania worked on while at the SEC. B describes the requirements imposed by <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#page_52" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.11(b),</a> which explains what is necessary to allow another lawyer in the firm to work on a matter from which Dania is disqualified.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect. Dania must comply with the mandate of 1.9(c) not to use or reveal confidential information relating to the representation of a former client, but her protecting those confidences is insufficient, by itself, to allow the firm to continue to represent the defendant.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because for the purpose of analyzing conflicts, all offices of a firm are considered part of the same firm, even if they are in different cities.</p>
<p class="VST"><span id="page_250" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 250"><b>250</b></span></p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because Dania need not be fired if she is timely screened and the other requirements of <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_38" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.11</a> are met.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 10d.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>D is correct.</b> The US Supreme Court has not bound itself to any formal ethics code.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 10e.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>C is correct.</b> The <em>Caperton</em> case, <em>Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co. Inc.</em>, 556 U.S. 868 (2009), required a judge to be disqualified because he had received a very large contribution ($3 million) from a party, one that exceeded the contributions from all other persons combined. His participation was held to violate the Due Process clause of the 14th Amendment because it would impair fair adjudication. The court said in <em>Caperton</em> that the size of that contribution in comparison to the total amount contributed to the campaign was excessive and reflected on the judge’s impartiality. Here, in contrast, the contribution amounted to only two percent of the candidate’s funds.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect because, as the Supreme Court said, “not every contribution by a litigant . . . creates a probability of bias,” and Garner’s contribution was small compared to the total fund.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect because, given the small relative size of the contribution, recusal is not necessary, despite the lack of consent.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because disclosure alone could not solve the problem if the contribution was so large that it created a likelihood of bias.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 10f.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>C is correct.</b> <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_132" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.12(b)</a> generally prohibits lawyers who are serving as judges from negotiating for employment with lawyers for parties in matters in which the judges are participating personally and substantially. But the rule makes an explicit exception for lawyers who are serving as judicial law clerks and who notify the judge about the intended negotiation for employment.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect because of that exemption.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect because judicial law clerks who notify their judges as required by the rule are not barred from writing opinions favoring the client of the firm with which they were or are negotiating for employment.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because Evelyn would not have been subject to discipline even if she had drafted the opinion and submitted it to her judge while still negotiating for employment.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 10g.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>A is correct.</b> Under the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Williams-Yulee v. Fla. Bar</em>, 135 S. Ct. 1656 (2015), the Citizens United decision does not extend First Amendment protection to judicial candidates’ campaigns, and this rule in the Model Code is valid. The Court held that the rule serves a state’s compelling interest in preserving public confidence in the judiciary.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect because of this exception.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because although federal judges may be removed from office only by impeachment, Judge DuBois is a state court judge and states may sanction judges through their own processes, as Florida did in the <em>Williams-Yulee</em> case.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because the Model Code has no exception for contributions from close friends or relatives.</p>
<p class="VST"><span id="page_251" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 251"><b>251</b></span></p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 10h.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>D is correct.</b> <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_12_Article_3__Advocate.xhtml#id_55" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 3.5</a> states that a lawyer shall not communicate ex parte with a judge during the proceeding unless authorized to do so by law or court order. Rule 2.9 of the Model Code of Judicial Conduct describes the exceptional circumstances in which such ex parte communication is proper. It provides that when circumstances require it, ex parte communications for scheduling purposes, which does not address substantive matters, is permitted, provided that the judge makes provision promptly to notify all other parties of the substance of the ex parte communication and gives them an opportunity to respond. That was done here.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect because no rule requires prior notice to Manfred, though it might have been better for her to have waited at least a day to try to reach Manfred before calling the judge’s chambers.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect because Rule 2.9 of the Model Code permits contact with a judge under the circumstances described in that rule.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because the tests of the propriety of these events are whether Erin’s conversation with the judge was for scheduling purposes and whether Manfred was given proper notice of what was discussed and an opportunity to respond, not whose fault it was that Erin had a conversation with the judge.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 10i.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>A is correct.</b> <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_12_Article_3__Advocate.xhtml#id_193a" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 3.6(A)</a> of the Model Code of Judicial Conduct bars a judge from holding membership in any organization that practices invidious discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. No equivalent rule applies to lawyers. <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_17_Article_8__Maintaining_the_Integ.xhtml#id_230" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 8.4(g)</a> was amended by the ABA House of Delegates in 2016 to prohibit a lawyer from engaging in conduct that the lawyer knows or reasonably should know is harassment or discrimination on the basis of “race, sex, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, age, <b><em>sexual orientation</em></b>, gender identity, marital status or socioeconomic status in conduct related to the practice of law” (emphasis added). Because the purpose of the club is to facilitate social interaction, and because Leonard does not engage in conduct related to the practice of law at the Antelope Club, the rule probably does not prohibit his membership there. The report of the ABA’s Standing Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility that urged the ABA’s House of Delegates to approve the anti-discrimination language in <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_17_Article_8__Maintaining_the_Integ.xhtml#id_230" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 8.4(g)</a> stated that its scope was “narrower and more limited” than the scope of <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_17_Article_8__Maintaining_the_Integ.xhtml#id_204" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 8.4(c),</a> which prohibits dishonesty and deceit by lawyer in all of their activities, whether or not related to the practice of law.

<p class="P107">A is incorrect. <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_12_Article_3__Advocate.xhtml#id_57" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 3.7</a> allows a lawyer to testify on an uncontested issue in a matter in which the lawyer is representing one of the parties. The issue on which Tito needs to testify, however, is whether the necklace was stolen or given. That issue is highly contested, so the uncontested issue exception does not apply.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because the rule allows Tito to testify to avoid substantial hardship.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because no judicial ruling is required.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 11d.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>C is correct.</b> Vojtech is in the awkward position of knowing of an impending fraud on the court but not being able to prevent it. <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_90" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.6(a)</a> bars a lawyer from revealing confidential information relating to representation of a client, unless an exception applies. No exception applies here. 1.6(b)(2) only allows revelation of client fraud to prevent reasonably certain substantial financial injury to another if the lawyer’s services were used in the perpetration of the fraud. Vojtech’s services have not been used to perpetrate a fraud. <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_12_Article_3__Advocate.xhtml#id_212" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 3.3(b)</a> does not apply because Vojtech is no longer representing a client in an adjudicative proceeding. Perhaps the rule should allow a lawyer to reveal information in this setting, but it provides no latitude with respect to a former client.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect because Vojtech’s silence does not constitute assistance to a client’s commission of a crime or fraud.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect because the confidentiality rules provide no exception that would allow Vojtech to reveal the information to the new counsel or the court, even when a lawyer is aware of a fraud that affects a judicial proceeding.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because there is no exception to confidentiality based on financial harm to a person unless the lawyer’s services were used to commit a crime or fraud.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 11e.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>D is correct.</b> <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_12_Article_3__Advocate.xhtml#id_57" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 3.7</a> would bar Athena from acting as an advocate in the proceeding and also testifying as a witness. The rule allows a lawyer to serve as both advocate and witness <span id="page_253" class="VST" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 253"><b>253</b></span>where the subject matter of a lawyer’s testimony is uncontested. But in this case, Athena may not serve as both advocate and witness, because the issue on which she would testify is contested. No other exception applies because the matter does not involve legal fees, and the advocate/ witness rule imposes no substantial hardship imposed on a client, since Ernest is not yet a client and he can retain a different lawyer.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect because the problem involves her serving as both advocate and witness for the estate, and the fact that her testimony would be truthful is not an exception to the rule.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect because a lack of previous representation is also not an exception to the prohibition on serving as an advocate and a witness.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect. Serving as an advocate and a witness as to a contested issue is impermissible for the reasons explained above. Therefore, Athena may not represent Ernest and testify even though her testimony is at not odds with her Ernest’s position in the matter.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 11f.</b></p>

<p class="P107">A and B are incorrect because Mort did not counsel Julio to give evidence that is false.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_12_Article_3__Advocate.xhtml#id_53" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 3.3</a> is applicable to depositions as well as to trials. Comment 1.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 11h.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>D is correct.</b> Libby knows that Ira’s statement was material to the case and false, and that Ira deliberately concealed the complaint record from the jury. Under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_12_Article_3__Advocate.xhtml#id_226" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 3.3(a)(3),</a> “If a lawyer, the lawyer’s client, or a witness called by the lawyer has offered material evidence and the lawyer comes to know of its falsity, the lawyer shall take reasonable remedial measures, including, if necessary, disclosure to the tribunal.” Comment 10 explains that she must remonstrate with her client, but if the client will not correct the false evidence, she must take further action, including disclosure to the tribunal if withdrawal from representation “will not undo the effect of the false evidence.” The disclosure must be that which “is reasonably necessary to remedy the situation” even if this “requires the lawyer to reveal information that otherwise would be protected by <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_10_Article_1__Client_Lawyer_Relatio.xhtml#id_36" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 1.6</a>.”</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect because the evidence was false. It is possible that Ira could avoid a perjury conviction because of the way he phrased his answer, because the standard for perjury convictions under <em>Bronston v. United States</em>, 409 U.S. 352 (1973), is extremely strict. But the standard of falsity in <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_12_Article_3__Advocate.xhtml#id_53" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 3.3</a> is not the same as the standard applied in criminal prosecutions for perjury.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect because the duty to correct false testimony continues until the end of the proceeding, including any appeal. <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_12_Article_3__Advocate.xhtml#id_53" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 3.3</a>, Comment 13.

Comment 7 explains that in the case of a represented organization such as a corporation, this Rule “prohibits communications with a constituent of the organization who supervises, directs or regularly consults with the organization’s lawyer concerning the matter or has authority to obligate the organization with respect to the matter or <em>whose act or omission in connection with the matter may be imputed to the organization for purposes of civil or criminal liability</em>” (emphasis added). Because Xavier’s acts or omissions may be imputed to the organization for purposes of liability, Maude needs Peter’s permission before interviewing him.</p>
<p class="P107">The other answers are accordingly incorrect.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 12b.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>B is correct.</b> <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_13_Article_4__Transactions_with_Per.xhtml#id_62" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 4.2</a> prohibits communication about the subject of the representation with a person the lawyer knows to be represented “in the matter” unless the lawyer has the consent of that person’s lawyer. If Tom does not know that Manuel has a lawyer in connection with his non-payment of rent, he may communicate with Manuel. Comment 8 says that a lawyer may not “evade the requirement of obtaining the consent of counsel by closing his eyes to the obvious,” but the rule does not require the lawyer to ask if Manuel has a lawyer in the matter.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect because if Manuel does not have representation in the matter, he is an unrepresented person and <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_13_Article_4__Transactions_with_Per.xhtml#page_96" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 4.3</a> applies. <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_13_Article_4__Transactions_with_Per.xhtml#page_96" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 4.3</a> imposes some restrictions even when no proceeding is pending, such as the duty not to state that the lawyer is disinterested. Comment 2 to <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_13_Article_4__Transactions_with_Per.xhtml#page_96" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 4.3</a> advises that if a lawyer negotiates the settlement of a dispute with an unrepresented person, the lawyer should identify himself as the attorney for an adverse party.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because if Tom knows that Manuel has a lawyer but does not know that the lawyer is representing him in the landlord-tenant matter, <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_13_Article_4__Transactions_with_Per.xhtml#id_62" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 4.2</a> does not impose obligations.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because neither <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_13_Article_4__Transactions_with_Per.xhtml#id_62" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 4.2</a> nor <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_13_Article_4__Transactions_with_Per.xhtml#page_96" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 4.3</a> imposes an obligation to make inquiries to ascertain whether Manuel has a lawyer, or to advise Manuel of his rights, although <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_13_Article_4__Transactions_with_Per.xhtml#page_96" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 4.3</a> would permit Tom to advise Manuel to retain counsel. Despite the absence of an obligation, Tom would be well-advised to start this conversation by asking Tom if he is represented in this matter. This would avoid future controversy about what Tom knew and when he knew it, if it turned out that Manuel had, after all, retained a lawyer about a possible eviction.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 12c.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>B is correct.</b> Toby is evidently under the misimpression that Sam is a police investigator, as evidenced by the phrase “your station.” Sam must clarify his role to correct Toby’s misimpression.

<p class="P107">A is incorrect; while a lawyer may advise a witness of his right to obtain legal counsel, he has no obligation to do so under these circumstances, where the person being interviewed does not appear to have interests adverse to those of the lawyer’s client.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect. Sam owes to Toby the duty to correct his misunderstanding of Sam’s role, even though Toby does not have interests adverse to those of Alan.</p>

Also, ABA Formal Op. 11-460 notes that information that is deliberately sent rather than inadvertently sent is not covered by <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_13_Article_4__Transactions_with_Per.xhtml#id_225" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 4.4(b)</a>.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect for that reason.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect because the handbook warned that e-mails sent over the company’s system could be read and disclosed by others, so Celinda was on notice, even if she did not read the handbook, that she had no expectation of privacy.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because the rules make no distinction between litigation and arbitration with respect to the duty to disclose.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 12e.</b></p>

Burt’s confession, combined with the evidence of his blood at the scene of the crime, would give Daniel knowledge of “new, credible and material evidence creating a reasonable likelihood” that Ray did not murder Tammy.

<p class="C162"><b>A is correct.</b> Comment 7 following <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_13_Article_4__Transactions_with_Per.xhtml#id_62" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 4.2</a> explains that a lawyer may not, without consent of opposing counsel for a corporation, contact an employee of a corporation who “has authority to obligate the organization with respect to the matter or whose act or omission <span id="page_257" class="VST" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 257"><b>257</b></span>in connection with the matter may be imputed to the organization . . . .” But, as in <em>Messing, Rudavsky &amp; Weliky, P.C. v. President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College</em>, 764 N.E. 2d 825 (Mass. 2002), a lawyer may, without such consent, contact a present employee who has no managing authority and who is not alleged to have committed wrongful acts at issue in the litigation.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect for this reason.</p>
<p class="P107">C and D are incorrect because a lawyer in this situation has no obligation to notify a witness of her right to seek independent legal advice.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 12k.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>B is correct.</b> While the state courts and the other federal courts have adopted versions of the Model Code of Judicial Conduct or another ethics code to govern the conduct of sitting judges, the United States Supreme Court has declined to adopt an ethics code to govern the justices. This means, for example, that no articulated standard guides the justices in deciding whether to recuse themselves in the face of possible conflicts of interest.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect. The ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct does not have the force of law. Each state adopts an ethics code; lawyers admitted in that state must comply with that code or face discipline. The state ethics codes are most often based on the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect. The Restatement of the Law Governing Lawyers does synthesize the state ethics codes and the case law interpreting them, but it also synthesizes all other state and federal civil and criminal law governing lawyers. For example, the Restatement includes the standards for legal malpractice liability and for the disqualification of lawyers based on conflicts of interest.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect. Lawyers who work for the federal government are admitted to the practice of law by one or more states, and compliance with the state ethics code is a condition of maintaining a license to practice. The McDade Amendment makes clear that the state ethics codes bind federal government lawyers. Because it is statutory, the McDade Amendment overrides any contrary federal agency regulations. Therefore, federal government lawyers are not exempt from compliance with the state ethics codes.</p>

<p class="C162"><b>Question 13a.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>C is correct.</b> Under amendments adopted by the ABA House of Delegates in August of 2018, <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_16_Article_7__Information_About_Leg.xhtml#id_221" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 7.3(a)</a> prohibits a lawyer from soliciting professional employment “by live, person-to-person contact” if a significant motive for doing so is pecuniary gain. The rule makes exceptions where the prospective client is a lawyer, “has a family, close personal, or prior business or professional relationship with the lawyer or law firm,” or where the prospective client “routinely uses for business purposes the type of legal service offered by the lawyer.”</p>
<p class="P107">A is not prohibited by <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_16_Article_7__Information_About_Leg.xhtml#id_79" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 7.3</a> because in the rule prohibits solicitation by live, person-to-person contact, but does not prohibit use of electronic (or telephonic) contact with prospective clients.</p>
<p class="P107">B is not prohibited because in the situation described, the lawyer has a prior professional relationship with the client.</p>
<p class="P107">D is not prohibited because no rule prohibits mailed solicitation of business from prospective clients.</p>

<p class="P107">A is incorrect, because the rule makes no exception for a familial relationship between the lawyer and a prospective partner.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect. The purpose of the prohibition is to protect the independent professional judgment of the lawyer, but the investment is prohibited regardless of steps taken to that end by Betsy.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_14_Article_5__Law_Firms_and_Associa.xhtml#id_217" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 5.4(b)</a> states “A lawyer shall not form a partnership with a nonlawyer if any of the activities of the partnership consist of the practice of law.” It does not matter whether the lawyer’s partner is a general partner or a limited partner.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 13c.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>C is correct.</b> Under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_14_Article_5__Law_Firms_and_Associa.xhtml#id_219" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 5.5(c),</a> a lawyer “may provide temporary legal services” in a jurisdiction in which he is not admitted if the services “arise out of or are reasonably related to the lawyer’s practice in a jurisdiction in which the lawyer is admitted to practice.” Esteban’s advice is “temporary” because Esteban is providing it only to help Patrick start up his business rather than on an ongoing basis. <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_14_Article_5__Law_Firms_and_Associa.xhtml#id_67" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 5.5</a>, Comment 6 explains that “services may be temporary, even though the lawyer provides services in this jurisdiction on a recurring basis, or for an extended period of time….” This example clearly qualifies as “temporary” legal services. It is related to his practice in State A because he already provides business advice to Patrick in State A.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect because the rules do not require a lawyer to disclose where the lawyer is licensed to practice law.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect because under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_14_Article_5__Law_Firms_and_Associa.xhtml#id_67" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 5.5</a>, Esteban may provide certain temporary legal services in State B without being admitted to practice there.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_14_Article_5__Law_Firms_and_Associa.xhtml#id_67" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 5.5</a> imposes restrictions on out-of-state practice even for lawyers who are competent and licensed.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 13d.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>C is correct.</b> <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_16_Article_7__Information_About_Leg.xhtml#id_79" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 7.3</a> prohibits in-person solicitation by lawyers if a significant motive for the solicitation is pecuniary gain. The rule allows in-person solicitation even motivated by a desire for income if the person contacted by the lawyer is herself a lawyer, is a person with whom the lawyer or the law firm has a prior close personal or business relationship, or the person is a regular user of legal services of the type offered. Pedestrian accident victims would not be “regular users” of such services, so C correctly states that this type of contact is forbidden.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect. Ethical rules against in-person solicitation were upheld in <em>Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass’n,</em> 436 U.S. 447 (1978) (upholding a total ban of in-person solicitation when the primary motivation behind the contact is the attorney’s pecuniary gain). The Court found that in-person solicitation was protected by the Constitution if the goal was to benefit the public rather than to generate private income for the lawyer. In re Primus, 436 U.S. 412 (1978) (holding that direct in-person solicitation is entitled to greater constitutional protection against state regulation when the attorney is motivated by the desire to promote political goals rather than pecuniary gain).</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect; lawyers and insurance adjusters are regulated by different entities, and no court has held that the same solicitation rules have to apply to both.</p>
<p class="VST"><span id="page_259" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 259"><b>259</b></span></p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect; a lawyer may challenge the validity of an ethics rule by violating the rule and raising the objection as a defense to a disciplinary proceeding. Therefore, Ian might deliberately violate the rule to invoke discipline and test its validity. That was the procedure followed by Dominic Gentile in <em>Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada</em>, 501 U.S. 1030 (1991).</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 13e.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>C is correct.</b> Although <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_16_Article_7__Information_About_Leg.xhtml#id_78" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 7.2</a> states that “a lawyer shall not compensate, give or promise anything of value to a person for recommending the lawyer’s services,” <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_16_Article_7__Information_About_Leg.xhtml#id_218" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Comment 4</a> to <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_16_Article_7__Information_About_Leg.xhtml#id_78" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 7.2</a> explains that “[p]aragraph (b)(5) permits lawyers to give nominal gifts as an expression of appreciation to a person for recommending the lawyer’s services or referring a prospective client. The gift may not be more than a token item as might be given for holidays, or other ordinary social hospitality.”</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect for the same reason.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect. Comment 4 to <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_16_Article_7__Information_About_Leg.xhtml#id_78" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 7.2</a> states: “A gift is prohibited if offered or given in consideration of any promise, agreement or understanding that such a gift would be forthcoming or that referrals would be made or encouraged in the future.” However, Margery’s intention is not to pay people for the referrals but to thank them.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because although a lawyer may give a thank-you gift to another lawyer, the value of permissible gifts is restricted by <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_16_Article_7__Information_About_Leg.xhtml#id_78" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 7.2</a>.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 13f.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>D is correct.</b> The advertisement does not include any false or misleading information, so there is no violation of <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_16_Article_7__Information_About_Leg.xhtml#id_77" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 7.1</a>.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect because Comment 9 to <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_16_Article_7__Information_About_Leg.xhtml#id_78" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 7.2</a> states: “Paragraph (c) of this Rule permits a lawyer to communicate that the lawyer does or does not practice in particular areas of law. A lawyer is generally permitted to state that the lawyer ‘concentrates in’ or is a ‘specialist,’ practices a ‘specialty,’ or ‘specializes in’ particular fields based on the lawyer’s experience, specialized training or education....”</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect.

Suzette includes her phone numbers so this requirement in the rule is met. <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_16_Article_7__Information_About_Leg.xhtml#id_78" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 7.2</a> used to require that a lawyer list her office address in an ad. This rule was amended by the ABA in 2018 to eliminate that requirement.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect. The Supreme Court decided in <em>Bates v. State Bar of Arizona</em>, 433 U.S. 350 (1977), that a complete ban on lawyer advertising would be unconstitutional, but it explicitly recognized that some regulation of advertising by states was acceptable.</p>

<h2 id="P2-R2-14" class="C835"><b>14<span class="C859">.</span>Access to Justice: The Lawyer’s Role</b></h2>
<p class="C162"><b>Question 14a.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>D is correct.</b> A lawyer is not subject to discipline even if he fails to comply with the guidelines for pro bono work listed in <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_15_Article_6__Public_Service.xhtml#id_71" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 6.1</a>. The rule says “A lawyer <em>should aspire to</em> render at least (50) hours of pro bono publico legal services per year.” The less-than mandatory language of the rule indicates that lawyers have discretion as to whether and how they comply. If the language of the rule were mandatory, Duncan would be subject to discipline. <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_15_Article_6__Public_Service.xhtml#id_216" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 6.1(a)</a> provides that lawyers should provide at least 50 hours of pro bono services annually and that “a substantial majority” of the 50 hours of pro bono service should be provided “without fee or expectation of fee.” Duncan is not providing any hours of service at no fee.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect because of the non-mandatory language of the rule.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect for that reason and is also incorrect because the standard in the rule does not require that the recipients of the service be destitute, but only that they be persons “of limited means.” People whose families are below the poverty line are “of limited means.” Comment 3 specifies that persons who qualify for participation in programs funded by the Legal Services Corporation are eligible under <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_15_Article_6__Public_Service.xhtml#id_216" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 6.1(a),</a> and persons in families below the poverty level are among those who qualify even if they are not utterly destitute.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because of the non-mandatory language of the rule and also because if the rule were mandatory, a substantial majority of the 50 hours should be provided without fee, not at a discounted rate.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 14b.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>D is correct.</b> With some exceptions, there is no due process right to counsel in civil cases. The <em>Kras</em> case, 409 U.S. 434 (1973), is widely cited for the origin of that rule. <em>Lassiter v. Department of Social Services</em>, 452 U.S. 18 (1981) rejected any presumption that there is a right to counsel in civil cases, but it opened the door to the possibility that under some circumstances, a court could require counsel for an indigent who was threatened with the loss of fundamental rights. The courts have rarely found that those factors warranted appointment of counsel for indigents, but some courts have appointed counsel for indigents in some particularly compelling cases, especially when the government was seeking to terminate parental rights or to commit a person to a mental institution involuntarily. See John Pollack, Walking Before Running: Implementation of a Right to Counsel in Civil Cases, 14 MIE J. 6 (2010), <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2560620" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2560620</a>. See also <em>Turner v. Rogers</em>, 131 S. Ct. 2507 (2011) (suggesting that appointment of counsel for indigents in civil matters is not constitutionally required, but if an indigent party’s ability to pay is a key substantive issue in the case, and counsel is not provided, “substitute procedural safeguards” are necessary.</p>
<p class="P107">The other answers are therefore incorrect.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 14c.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>B is correct.</b> Comment 5 to <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_15_Article_6__Public_Service.xhtml#id_71" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 6.1</a> allows employees who are barred from performing pro bono services to individuals and organizations to satisfy the obligation by engaging in the activities specified in <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_15_Article_6__Public_Service.xhtml#id_214" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 6.1(b)</a>. One of those activities is “participation in activities for improving the law, the legal system or the legal profession.”</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect because, although financial contributions to organizations that provide legal services to the poor are encouraged by the last sentence of the rule, contributions cannot substitute for personal participation.</p>
<p class="VST"><span id="page_261" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 261"><b>261</b></span></p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because government lawyers need not represent individual clients to fulfill the aspirational obligations of <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_15_Article_6__Public_Service.xhtml#id_71" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 6.1</a>.

<p class="P107">D is incorrect. It is true that the agency regulations take precedence over a merely aspirational professional conduct rule, but she may comply with both <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_15_Article_6__Public_Service.xhtml#id_71" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 6.1</a> and her agency’s regulations by participating in law reform efforts.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 14d.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>A is correct.</b> This problem is similar to <em>Evans v. Jeff D.</em>, 475 U.S. 717 (1986), in which the Supreme Court held that the Fees Act did not bar a settlement offer that was conditioned on the plaintiff’s lawyer waiving attorney’s fees to which the lawyer would otherwise be entitled. The Truth in Lending Act is similar to the Fees Act in that it provides that a prevailing plaintiff’s lawyer can recover attorney fees from a defendant.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect because nothing in <em>Jeff D.</em> or other law requires the defendant’s lawyer to waive fees, even if that lawyer is requiring her adversary to do so as a condition of settlement.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because no rule prohibits a party from making a settlement offer whose effect is to create a conflict of interest for a plaintiff. Such an offer may have been made, for example, in <em>Fiandaca v. Cunningham</em>, 827 F. 2d 825 (1st Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because in <em>Jeff D.</em>, the majority opinion did not accept an argument made by the dissent that the attorney fee provision in the Fees Act should override the judicially created policy of encouraging settlements.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 14e.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>B is correct.</b> The Fees Act allows plaintiffs’ lawyers who prevail in federal civil rights litigation against state agencies to be awarded counsel fees to be paid by the defendant. But under the Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Buckhannon Bd. &amp; Care Home v. West Virginia</em>, 532 U.S. 598 (2001), a plaintiff is not deemed to prevail unless the case results in a court order in the plaintiff’s favor. An out-of-court settlement or a voluntary change in the defendant’s practices will not suffice.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect because <em>Buckhannon</em> requires a court order embodying the changed practice before fees can be awarded.</p>
<p class="P107">C is incorrect because the Fees Act has never been held unconstitutional and is often the basis for fee shifting when plaintiffs prevail in cases like this, provided that the plaintiffs obtain a court decree or order sustaining their claims.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect because the Fees Act abrogates the American rule for federal civil rights cases against state actors.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 14f.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>C describes his best option.</b> Amar would like to work in the public sector indefinitely. If he stays at legal aid or works at any “501(c)(3)” non-profit or government agency and makes 120 monthly on-time payments while in income-based repayment, he will not only lower his monthly payments substantially, but he will also qualify to have his loan balance forgiven, tax-free, after he makes the 120th payment. The rising balance due will not affect him; it is only a measure of the amount of debt to be forgiven.</p>
<p class="P107">A is not a good option, because if he is sued, he will stand to lose not only whatever money or other assets he has or may later accumulate, and he could also suffer severe damage to his professional reputation.</p>
<p class="P107">B is not a good option because with very rare exceptions, student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="VST"><span id="page_262" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 262"><b>262</b></span></p>
<p class="P107">D is not a good option because he would be trading work that he enjoys for drudgery. In the private firm, his income would still be relatively low, and he could still use income-based repayment to lower his monthly payments. But because he would be working in the private sector rather than the public sector, he would not qualify for forgiveness before repaying for 25 years, and any forgiveness at that point would be taxable.</p>
<p class="C160"><b>Question 14g.</b></p>
<p class="C162"><b>C is correct.</b> <a href="https://jigsaw.vitalsource.com/books/9781543827231/epub/OEBPS/9781543827231_14_Article_5__Law_Firms_and_Associa.xhtml#id_202" style="overflow-wrap: break-word;">Rule 5.5(a)</a> provides that a lawyer may not assist another in practicing law in violation of the regulation of the legal profession in the jurisdiction in question. With very limited exceptions, such as Washington State’s program of licensing legal technicians, all jurisdictions prohibit non-lawyers from giving legal advice, so Ann should not assist Pablo in giving legal advice, no matter how well-intentioned either Pablo or Ann is.</p>
<p class="P107">A is incorrect for that reason.</p>
<p class="P107">B is incorrect because lawyers may give legal advice to undocumented persons—but nonlawyers may not.</p>
<p class="P107">D is incorrect. Assuring that Pablo’s services are competent does not solve the problem because by giving this answer, Ann disclaims responsibility (e.g., malpractice and disciplinary liability) for whatever errors or malfeasance Pablo might commit.</p>
