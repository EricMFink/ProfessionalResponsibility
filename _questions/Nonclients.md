### Question 11

Attorney is representing a client in a civil case involving an alleged breach of contract. A crucial issue in the case will be what the parties intended by certain provisions in their complicated contract. In discovery, Attorney has received an electronic version of the contract from her adversary's attorney. Attorney is informed that he can access certain “meta-data" in that contract, which may include revisions and comments that were made by the opposing party (and not its counsel) during the negotiations over the contract.

### Question 12

Attorney wants to suggest to her client that the client approach the husband directly about resolving all issues by agreement. Attorney could coach her client on how to approach the husband and how best to negotiate a good deal. Is Attorney's plan consistent with her responsibilities under the Model Rules of Professional Conduct? 

### Question 13


Attorney is in the midst of trying to negotiate the settlement of a civil claim with the assistance of a mediator. The mediator, who is not a judge, is conducting the settlement negotiations in a "caucus” format, and is shuttling back and forth between the parties. Ordinarily, Attorney would feel free in a negotiation to bluff about her settlement authority by telling the plaintiff's counsel that she cannot exceed a certain payment, even if her authority is actually for a greater amount. May Attorney engage in this tactic in a caucused mediation?
