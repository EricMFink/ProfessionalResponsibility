## ANSWERS  

### Question 1

The correct answer is (B). Lawyers are not under a general duty to offer unsolicited advice to clients, but here the client has instructed the lawyer to perform a task that wil serious adverse consequences for the client. See Comment 5 to Rule 2.1. The lawyer's obligation to communicate with the client under Rule 1.4(b) will require the lawyer to alert the client to the breach of contract. Answer (A) is incorrect because, although lawyers must not assist clients in the perpetration of a crime or fraud, there is nothing in the rules to prevent a lawyer from assisting with a mere breach of contract. Answer (C) is wrong because the lawyer has a duty to advise. Answer (D) is wrong because the lawyer is under no duty to follow the client's instructions. If the lawyer has a fundamental disagreement with the client or finds the client's proposed course of action to be repugnant, the lawyer may withdraw. Rule 1.16(b)(4).  

### Question 2

The correct answer is (B). Under Rule 2.3, lawyers are generally permitted to provide an evaluation for a client to a third person, but only if doing so is compatible with other aspects of the lawyer's relationship with the client. Here, the lawyer's roles as advocate and as evaluator are fundamentally inconsistent, and the lawyer may not do both. See Comment 3 to Rule 2.3. Answer (A) is incorrect because informed consent is not enough if the evaluation is incompatible with the lawyer's other role as advocate. Answer (C) is incorrect because the key issue is not the effect on the client but the incompatible nature of the roles the lawyer is being asked to fulfill. An advocate simply has a different job than a dispassionate evaluator should have. Furthermore, the lawyer's report might well be discoverable by the opposing party – it is not privileged and it is not prepared in anticipation of litigation or preparation for trial — and even "favorable" evaluations could prove useful to an opposing party in litigation. Answer (D) is wrong because such a standard would make it impossible for a lawyer ever to prepare an evaluation for the use of third parties. Such evaluations are permitted as long as the requirements of Rule 2.3 are met.  

### Question 3

The correct answer is (D). Under Rule 2.1, a lawyer may accept a request for technical legal advice at face value when the request comes from a sophisticated consumer of legal services like the general counsel for Monolith. See Comment 2 to Rule 2.1. Answer (A) is incorrect because sometimes lawyers may not take such requests at face value, such as when the request comes from a client who is inexperienced in legal matters. Id. Answer (B) is incorrect because the lawyer is free to give the requested technical legal advice to a sophisticated consumer of legal services. Answer (C) is incorrect because sometimes lawyers may give just technical legal advice, such as when a client like Monolith asks for it. Answer (D) is correct.  

### Question 4

The correct answer is Answer (A). This is a rotten thing that Barbara wants to do, and to some it would be an immoral thing not to treat all the children fairly. Under Rule 2.1, lawyers are permitted but not required to counsel clients about the morality of their  proposed courses of action. Answer (B) is incorrect because such counseling is merely permitted and not required. Answer (C) is incorrect because Rule 2.1 allows lawyers to counsel clients about things other than the law, including questions of morality. Answer (D) is incorrect because the lawyer can assist with this transaction as long as it is not criminal or fraudulent. Lawyers are not prohibited from helping clients do legal but immoral things. Answer (A) is correct.  

### Question 5

The correct answer is (B). Under Rule 2.3, a lawyer who provides an evaluation for a client for use by third parties may or may not owe legal duties to the third parties. The existence and scope of any such duty is governed by other law and not the Rules of Professional Conduct. See Comment 3 to Rule 2.3. Answer (D) is wrong because there may be duties  e under other law to third parties. Answer (A) is wrong because the Rules of Professional Conduct do not purport to impose the same duties a lawyer would owe a client on a lawyer performing an evaluation for third parties. Answer (C) is incorrect even though it correctly states that a lawyer cannot make a false statement of material fact to a third party. See Rule 4.1. Because other law may impose additional duties, however, Answer (C) is incomplete and therefore incorrect. Answer (B) is correct.  

### Question 6

Fernando's duty is to give his client the benefit of his independent professional judgment and candid advice. Here, the lawyer is obligated to deliver bad news, to have a very difficult discussion with the client. The lawyer's duty to give candid advice exists even if that advice is going to be unpalatable to the client. Comment 1 to Rule 2.1. Fernando may articulate his advice in the best way possible to maintain his client's morale, consistent with his duty to be truthful, but he cannot be dissuaded from giving his best advice just because the client is not going to like what she hears.  John must tell his client that John will have to include in the opinion the limitations that the client placed upon his ability to investigate. See Comment 4 to Rule 2.3. The client is entitled to know that because the client has a decision to make: whether to allow John to continue, give John full disclosure, or to allow John to deliver a qualified report. See Rule 1.4(b). Even if this advice is not pleasing to the client, the lawyer is obliged to give it. See Comment 1 to Rule 2.1.
