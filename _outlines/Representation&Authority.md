##### §2.02(1)

# Allocation of Decision-Making Authority

##### Rule 1.2(a)

Client retains authority over crucial decisions regarding purposes & goals of representation

- In civil cases, the client decides whether to sue and whether to settle
- In criminal cases, the client decides what plea to enter (e.g., guilty or innocent), whether to waive a jury trial, whether to testify, and whether to appeal
- The lawyer should counsel the client about the advantages, disadvantages, and alternatives

Lawyer retains authority over tactical & logistical/procedural decisions

- e.g., whether to depose a witness; whether to consent to an extension to file discovery responses

Lawyer should consult with client about these decisions, where possible

- If client objects to a lawyer’s tactical or technical decisions, lawyer should defer to the client’s wishes, unless client’s wishes are contrary to law or applicable ethics rules

#### Restatement of the Law Governing Lawyers, §§ 16-30

Client retains authority to decide ends; lawyer has authority to decide means

But in practice, allocation of decision-making authority as between attorney and client depends (in part) on the status of the parties

Heinz & Laumann, *Chicago Lawyers*

- Inverse relationship between degree of lawyer's decisional/operational autonomy and client's status

## Limited Scope of Representation

##### Rule 1.2(c)

A lawyer may limit the scope of the representation if the limitation is reasonable under the circumstances and the client gives informed consent, e.g., The lawyer will handle the trial, but not any appeals

But lawyer may not:

- Limit the right of the client to fire the lawyer
- Ask the client to accept “incompetent” representation (e.g., waive claims for ordinary negligence)
- Limit the client’s right to settle the case
- Prospectively limit the lawyer’s liability for malpractice

##### Example

L’s standard retainer agreement contains the following clause: “Client agrees not to hold Lawyer liable for negligence and agrees not to file suit against Lawyer.” 

- L is subject to discipline.

In these circumstances, the lawyer shall also advise the client regarding related federal law and policy.
