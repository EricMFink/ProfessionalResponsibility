﻿Withdrawal from Representation

Rule 1.16(a)
(a) Except as stated in paragraph (c), a lawyer shall not represent a client or, where representation has commenced, shall withdraw from the representation of a client if:
(1) the representation will result in violation of the rules of professional conduct or other law;
(2) the lawyer's physical or mental condition materially impairs the lawyer's ability to represent the client; or
(3) the lawyer is discharged.


Problem
Lawyer, a partner in the Smith Law Firm, represents A in litigation.  When A receives a document production request, A instructs Lawyer to destroy some relevant documents.  Lawyer explains to A that such destruction is illegal and unethical, but A insists that Lawyer destroy the documents.  What are Lawyer’s ethical obligations?

May A fire Lawyer and, if so, does Lawyer have any recourse?


Problem
Lawyer represents A in a large business transaction.  Over the past few years, Lawyer has become addicted to illegal drugs.  The addiction has reached a point where Lawyer is unable to concentrate for more than a few minutes at a time.  A’s business transaction is very complicated and will take nearly one hundred hours to complete.  What are Lawyer’s ethical obligations?

Rule 1.16(b)
(b) Except as stated in paragraph (c), a lawyer may withdraw from representing a client if:
(1) withdrawal can be accomplished without material adverse effect on the interests of the client;
(2) the client persists in a course of action involving the lawyer's services that the lawyer reasonably believes is criminal or fraudulent;
(3) the client has used the lawyer's services to perpetrate a crime or fraud;
(4) the client insists upon taking action that the lawyer considers repugnant or with which the lawyer has a fundamental disagreement;
(5) the client fails substantially to fulfill an obligation to the lawyer regarding the lawyer's services and has been given reasonable warning that the lawyer will withdraw unless the obligation is fulfilled;
(6) the representation will result in an unreasonable financial burden on the lawyer or has been rendered unreasonably difficult by the client; or 
(7) other good cause for withdrawal exists.

Problem
A hires Lawyer to represent A in a products liability suit.  Within the first week, A and Lawyer realize that they are incompatible.  Accordingly, they agree that it would be best for A to find a new lawyer.  The litigation is in its early stages and thus A will not be prejudiced by a change of lawyers.  May A withdraw?  

Problem
Lawyer, a partner in the Smith Law Firm, represents A in litigation.  When A receives a document production request, A decides to destroy some relevant documents.  Lawyer learns of A’s plans and explains to A that such destruction is illegal and unethical, but A insists on destroying the documents.  Must Lawyer withdraw?
May Lawyer withdraw?
Problem
An attorney experienced several instances when clients failed to pay their fees in a timely manner, but it was too late in the representation to withdraw without prejudicing the clients. To avoid a recurrence of this situation, the attorney has drafted a stipulation of consent to withdraw if fees are not paid according to the fee agreement.  She proposes to have all clients sign the stipulation at the outset of the representation.  Is it proper for the attorney to use the stipulation to withdraw from representation whenever a client fails to pay fees?
A. Yes, because a lawyer may withdraw when the financial burden of continuing the representation would be substantially greater than the parties anticipated at the time of the fee agreement.
B. Yes, because the clients consented to the withdrawal in the stipulation.
C. No, because a client’s failure to pay fees when due may be insufficient in itself to justify withdrawal.
D. No, unless clients are provided an opportunity to seek independent legal advice before signing the stipulation.

Problem
Client has retained Attorney to represent Client in a contract suit.  Attorney’s retainer agreement provided that Attorney’s fees would be based on a fixed hourly rate, payable at the end of each calendar month.  Two months before trial, Client fell behind in the payment of Attorney’s monthly billing for fees.  Attorney included the following statement on Attorney’s last bill to Client: “Your account is more than thirty days past due.  If amounts due are not paid promptly in accordance with our agreement, I will terminate the representation.  If you cannot pay the amount due, I will accept an assignment of your cause of action as security for your fee to me.” Two weeks after the last billing, Attorney telephoned Client and told Client that Attorney would withdraw from representing Client if the bill was not paid within forty-eight hours or adequate security given for its payment. If the bill remains unpaid or unsecured after forty-eight hours, it would be proper for Attorney to:
I.	upon notice to Client, move the court for permission to withdraw.
II.	turn Client’s file over to another experienced lawyer in town and notify Client that Attorney no longer represents Client.
III.	accept an assignment of Client’s cause of action as security for Attorney’s fees.

A.	I only.
B.	II only.
C.	I and II, but not III.
D.	I, II, and III.
Problem
For many years, Attorney served as outside counsel for Corp.  Shortly after a change in management, Attorney discovered what she reasonably believed to be a material misstatement in a document she had drafted that Attorney was about to file on Corp’s behalf with a government agency.  Attorney advised Corp’s Board of Directors that filing the document was probably criminal.  However, the Board disagreed that there was any material misstatement and directed Attorney to proceed with filing.  When Attorney indicated her intention to resign, Corp argued that resignation at this time would send a signal that there was a problem with the filing.  Corp urged Attorney to continue representation, but offered to use in-house counsel to complete the work on the filing.  Although she does not know for certain that filing the document is illegal, Attorney reasonably believes that it is.  In any event, Attorney is personally uncomfortable with the representation and wants to withdraw.  May Attorney withdraw from her representation of Corp?

Must Attorney withdraw?
Smith v. R.J. Reynolds
When may an attorney who represents a plaintiff on a contingent fee basis withdraw because of an “unreasonable financial burden”?

Rule 1.16(c-d)
(c) A lawyer must comply with applicable law requiring notice to or permission of a tribunal when terminating a representation. When ordered to do so by a tribunal, a lawyer shall continue representation notwithstanding good cause for terminating the representation.
(d) Upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client's interests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance payment of fee or expense that has not been earned or incurred. The lawyer may retain papers relating to the client to the extent permitted by other law.
Problem
Lawyer was retained by Client to defend Client in a pending criminal case.  Client has failed to pay Lawyer’s monthly fees for six consecutive months.  After numerous warnings, Lawyer would like to withdraw.  Lawyer files a motion with the court seeking leave to withdraw, but the court denies the motion.  What are Lawyer’s ethical obligations?

Assuming the court grants Lawyer leave to withdraw, what actions must Lawyer take to end her relationship with Client?

If Client fails to pay the past-due fees to Lawyer, is there anything Lawyer may do to ensure payment?
OREGON REV. STAT. § 87.430 
An attorney has a lien for compensation whether specially agreed upon or implied, upon all papers, personal property and money of the client in the possession of the attorney for services rendered to the client.  The attorney may retain the papers, personal property and money until the lien created by this section, and the claim based thereon, is satisfied, and the attorney may apply the money retained to the satisfaction of the lien and claim.



Sale of a Law Firm

Rule 1.17
A lawyer or a law firm may sell or purchase a law practice, or an area of law practice, including good will, if the following conditions are satisfied:
(a) The seller ceases to engage in the private practice of law, or in the area of practice that has been sold, [in the geographic area] [in the jurisdiction] (a jurisdiction may elect either version) in which the practice has been conducted;
(b) The entire practice, or the entire area of practice, is sold to one or more lawyers or law firms;
(c) The seller gives written notice to each of the seller's clients regarding:
(1) the proposed sale;
(2) the client's right to retain other counsel or to take possession of the file; and
(3) the fact that the client's consent to the transfer of the client's files will be presumed if the client does not take any action or does not otherwise object within ninety (90) days of receipt of the notice.
If a client cannot be given notice, the representation of that client may be transferred to the purchaser only upon entry of an order so authorizing by a court having jurisdiction. The seller may disclose to the court in camera information relating to the representation only to the extent necessary to obtain an order authorizing the transfer of a file.
(d) The fees charged clients shall not be increased by reason of the sale.
Problem
	The ABC law firm’s estate planning department has been losing money for years.  Consequently, ABC decides to sell its entire estate planning practice—including all estate planning clients—to XYZ law firm, which specializes in estate planning.  What duties do ABC owe to its estate planning clients?
May ABC sell only those clients with assets below $1 million?
May XYZ defray the acquisition costs by raising fees on clients it receives from ABC?

Rule 2.1
In representing a client, a lawyer shall exercise independent professional judgment and render candid advice. In rendering advice, a lawyer may refer not only to law but to other considerations such as moral, economic, social and political factors, that may be relevant to the client's situation.

Problem
Lawyer represents ABC Corp.  ABC has a very good breach of contract action against one of its regular customers, XYZ Corp.  ABC hires Lawyer to sue XYZ.  Lawyer advises ABC’s president that, “although you have a great lawsuit and I’m prepared to file the complaint, I do not think it is a wise business decision for you to sue a regular customer?”  Did Lawyer act properly?

Problem
Lawyer represents A in a child custody dispute.  A is the custodial parent of three children.  A’s former spouse, B, has filed the child custody suit in an attempt to obtain custody of the children.  A is a heavy drinker and has had considerable difficulty raising the children.  Lawyer advises A:  “I think you should seek treatment for your drinking and attend some parenting classes.”  Did Lawyer act properly?

Rule 2.3
(a) A lawyer may provide an evaluation of a matter affecting a client for the use of someone other than the client if the lawyer reasonably believes that making the evaluation is compatible with other aspects of the lawyer's relationship with the client.
(b) When the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the evaluation is likely to affect the client's interests materially and adversely, the lawyer shall not provide the evaluation unless the client gives informed consent.
(c) Except as disclosure is authorized in connection with a report of an evaluation, information relating to the evaluation is otherwise protected by Rule 1.6.
Problem
Lawyer, a partner in the Smith Law Firm, represents ABC Corp. in tax matters.  ABC works with other companies (“customers”) to reduce their income tax exposure.  ABC has created a new type of transaction which purportedly has significant tax advantages.  ABC would like to market this new transaction to its customers.  In order to make the new transaction more appealing to customers, ABC has asked Lawyer to prepare an opinion letter in which Lawyer opines on the tax advantages.  ABC will give this opinion letter to customers and potential customers.  May Lawyer prepare the opinion letter?

What should Lawyer do if she disagrees with ABC as to the tax advantages of the new transaction?
