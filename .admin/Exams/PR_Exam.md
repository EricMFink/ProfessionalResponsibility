### Question 1

Attorney represents Client in a personal injury action brought by Plaintiff. The suit alleged that Plaintiff was injured when a wooden plank in the front porch of Plaintiff's cabin gave way. Client is adamant that the porch was properly constructed and that Plaintiff must have concocted the story. Plaintiff's counsel arranges for an engineer to examine the porch. Two days before the engineer was scheduled to arrive, Attorney sends Investigator, an employee of Attorney, to examine the porch. Investigator tells Attorney that the porch was constructed of substandard material and a board had obviously come loose. The next day, before the engineer's appointment, a brushfire, caused by lightening, destroyed thousands of acres of forest, including the Client's cabin. 
 
Must Attorney inform Plaintiff's counsel about Investigator's findings? 

a. Yes, because Investigator's findings were material to Plaintiff's claim. 
b. Yes, because Plaintiff's expert was unable to conduct their examination. 
c. No, if Client truly believes the porch was properly constructed.
d. No, because the information was subject to the duty of confidentiality.

### Question 2
 
Attorney and Lawyer were partners in Attorney & Lawyer Law Firm for 25 years. After Attorney died, Lawyer continued in practice at the same location. She rented the extra office space to Counselor on a monthly basis. The rent included the use of a shared law library, conference room, and a secretary. Lawyer and Counselor do not represent each other's clients, nor do they share any fees paid by their respective clients. Attorney hangs a sign outside the office reading "Law Firm of Attorney, Lawyer & Counselor."

Is Attorney subject to discipline?

a. Yes, because Attorney and Counselor are not partners.
b. Yes, because Lawyer died prior to the arrangement between Attorney and Counselor.
c. No, because Attorney and Lawyer had been partners for the past 25 years.
d. No, because Attorney and Counselor were sharing office space, the law library, and secretarial services.

### Question 3
 
Attorney represents Client, a prominent business figure charged with securities fraud. Attorney and Client agree to an hourly fee arrangement, with monthly billing. The case proves to be more complex than anticipated, requiring Attorney to spend significantly more time. Faced with mounting legal bills, Client proposes that, instead of paying the hourly fees, he will assign to Attorney the rights to any literary or other media portrayal of Client's business career, including the securities fraud case. 

May Attorney agree to this arrangement? 
 
a. Yes, provided Attorney advises Client to obtain independent legal counsel and the value of the media rights would be a reasonable fee for Attorney's services. 
b. Yes, because a client may agree to any fee arrangement with his attorney.
c. No, because at the time of the agreement, Attorney's representation of Defendant had not concluded.
d. No, because the media rights could be worth more than the amount Attorney would receive under the hourly fee arrangement.

\newpage

### Question 4
 
Attorney represents Company in a lawsuit brought by Employee. The suit alleges that Company failed to pay Employee the full amount of sales commissions he earned over the past year. Attorney reviewed Company's records, which showed sales made and commissions paid. The records indicated that Employee was responsible for $1 million, but was paid commissions for only half those sales. Based on that information, Attorney believes Company should accept liability and settle with Employee.

What should Attorney do?

a. Advise Company of all options with the recommendation that it settle with Employee, and continue to represent Company even if it decides to reject the settlement and proceed to litigation.
b. Advise Company of all options with the recommendation that it settle with Employee, and withdraw from representation if Company decides to reject the settlement and proceed with litigation.
c. Withdraw from representation because Attorney believes Company does not have a case.
d. Settle the case as quickly as possible.

### Question 5
 
Attorney is a solo practitioner who represents clients in the formation of new businesses. Attorney meets with the clients to discuss their business plans and advise them about the options and legal requirements for various types of business entities. Once the client is ready to proceed, Attorney's paralegal completes the necessary legal forms, using information that Attorney has provided from the client meetings. 
 
Is it proper for Attorney to have the paralegal perform that task?
 
a. No, because the paralegal is engaging in the unauthorized practice of law.
b. No, unless there is a specific statute that allows paralegals to perform that task in that jurisdiction.
c. Yes, but only if the client gives informed written consent. 
d. Yes, as long as Attorney supervises and retains responsibility for the paralegal's work.

### Question 6
 
Attorney represents Plaintiff in a medical malpractice case against Doctor. Plaintiff maintains that Doctor negligently performed surgery on Patient's back, which was injured in a car collision. After a court hearing, Spectator stopped Attorney as he was walking out of the courtroom. Spectator told Attorney he was injured in a car collision with Plaintiff (the same collision in which Plaintiff's back was injured). Spectator wants Attorney to represent him in a personal injury suit against Plaintiff.
 
May Attorney represent Spectator in the personal injury suit against Plaintiff?
 
a. No, because Attorney is currently representing Plaintiff in the medical malpractice lawsuit.
b. No, unless Spectator consents to the representation after seeking independent advice.
c. Yes, because the medical malpractice suit is unrelated to the personal injury suit.
d. Yes, if both Spectator and Plaintiff consent to the representation. 

\newpage

### Question 7
 
For many years, Attorney has represented Client, the reputed head of an organized crime family, in various criminal cases. On four occasions, Attorney has successfully defended Client against murder charges. Client faces yet another murder charge, and has once again has retained Attorney to represent him.

Two weeks before the new trial date, Attorney, contacts the prosecutor in Client's murder case, explaining that the near-death experience caused him to reconsider his role as Client's mouthpiece. Attorney tells the prosecutor that Client admitted to all of the murders, including the pending case. Attorney is willing to testify against Client, hoping it will ease his conscience.
 
Is Attorney subject to discipline?
 
a. No, because he is preventing the perpetration of a fraud on the court.
b. No, because he no longer represents Client.
c. Yes, but only if the prosecutor calls Attorney as a witness at trial.
d. Yes, regardless of whether or not Attorney testifies at trial.

Attorney filed a medical malpractice suit against Doctor on behalf of Client. The suit centered around Client's claim that Doctor removed the wrong lump on her back. Prior to the suit being filed, Attorney subpoenaed the MRI report and discovered that the lump removed was actually the correct lump. Thinking that no one was watching, Attorney destroyed the only copy of the MRI report. However, Lawyer, a partner in the same firm, saw Attorney tear up the report
 
Is Partner subject to discipline for failing to report Attorney's conduct to an appropriate authority?
 
a. Yes, because partners in a law firm are vicariously liable for the misconduct of other lawyers in the firm. 
b. Yes, if Partner knew that the MRI report was a piece of evidence.
c. No, because Partner did not direct or assist Attorney in destroying the report.
d. No, because doing so would breach the duty of confidentiality to Client.

Store denies that it was on notice of the spill. During the trial, Attorney called Manager as a witness, and asked, "Isn't it true that another customer told you about the spill 5 minutes prior to the incident?" Manager responded, "No. I didn't know about the wet floor until I heard Client yell as he fell." In response, Attorney shouted: "You're lying. You knew that the floor was wet because you ordered it mopped up. How could you tell such a blatant lie?"

Was Attorney's conduct at trial proper?
 
a. Yes, if Attorney could prove that Manager was lying.
b. Yes, if Attorney has a good faith belief that Manager was lying.
c. No, because he expressed his personal opinion as to Manager's credibility.

### Question 10

Attorney represents Doctor in a medical malpractice lawsuit. Doctor had instructed the plaintiff to apply an ointment twice a day to control a rash. After the area of the rash became badly swollen and painful, the plaintiff contacted Doctor, who told her to keep using the ointment, but only once a day. Doctor keeps notes of all conversations with patients in the patient's file. Doctor tells Attorney that he altered the notes of his initial consultation with the plaintiff to indicate he'd told her to apply the ointment only once daily. Attorney decided that the alteration could easily be missed since Doctor's writing was difficult to read.
 
Must Attorney refuse to offer the altered medical record into evidence at trial?
 
a. Yes, but only if the Doctor made the alteration after Plaintiff filed her suit.
b. Yes, because Attorney knows the medical record has been falsified.
c. No, because it is the opposing attorney's duty to discover the alteration and raise it on cross-examination.
d. No, because Attorney has the duty to advocate zealously on behalf of Doctor.

Two years ago Client hired Attorney to represent her in a discrimination suit against Employer. During the initial consultation, Client informed Attorney of the circumstances surrounding her claim. Attorney decided that Client had a good case and accepted the representation. In accordance with the written representation and fee agreement, Client gave Attorney a check for $1,000 as an advance against fees and expenses, which Attorney promptly deposited in a client trust account. Because of several other matters that consumed all of Attorney's time, Attorney did no further work on Client's case for two years. During that time, Attorney never heard from Client. When the work for those other matters finally subsided, Attorney turned his attention back to Client's case and drafted a complaint on her behalf. As soon as he'd filed the complaint with the court, Attorney received a phone call from Client, who informed Attorney that she'd hired another lawyer to represent her in the discrimination case.

b. No, even if Pa gives informed consent.
c. Yes, because Attorney's representation of Pa ended when the paternity suit concluded.
d. Yes, if Ma pays Attorney from funds separate than those received from Pa.

### Question 20

Partner represents Company in various legal matters. Recently, Partner hired four associates to assist with a growing volume of work. Three of the associates quit within a few weeks, leaving only Associate. The rapid turnover, along with the lack of specificity in Partner's bills, have raised concerns among Company's directors. At the board's request, Company's CEO meets with Associate to review the recent bills. The entries for Associate provide specific breakdowns of time spent and work performed. But most of Partner's entries are vague, indicating large blocks of time for "case review and preparation". Several entries are for dates when Associate knew Partner had done no work and had played golf with other clients. Associate returns to the office and confronts Partner about the bills. Partner angrily tells Associate, "Mind your own business and keep your mouth shut". Fearful about losing her job, Associate decides not to pursue the matter any further. 
 
Is Associate subject to discipline?
 
a. No, because she is not responsible for Partner's misconduct.
b. No, because she is following Partner's instructions.

Soon after Associate was hired, Lawyer announced that he was taking a long-deferred vacation to a remote tropical island without any phone or internet access and would be gone for a month. He handed Associate a stack of files and told her, "While I'm away, I need you to negotiate and draft all these lease agreements for Client. I know you haven't done this before, so here's a sample agreement. You're very smart and I'm confident you'll do a great job. See you in a month."

a. No, because Lawyer did not adequately supervise Associate's work.
b. No, because Clients did not consent before Lawyer instructed Associate to draft the lease agreements.
c. Yes, because Lawyer gave Associate a sample lease agreement.
d. Yes, because Associate has passed the bar exam and is admitted to practice.

### Question 22

To promote her employment discrimination practice, Attorney runs a TV ad portraying a dramatized account of a past case. The ad opens with Attorney meeting with a client who tearfully recounts the persistent and severe harassment she has experienced at work. Next, it shows Attorney in court, delivering an impassioned argument on behalf of her client, after which a judge bangs his gavel and announces "I find in favor of the plaintiff and order the defendant to pay $1 million." It ends with a picture of Attorney and client toasting their victory, with a voice-over saying "If you've been harassed at work, call the Law Offices of Attorney and she'll get you the compensation you deserve!" and superimposed text giving Attorney's phone number and office address.
 
Is it proper for Attorney to run this ad? 
 
a. Yes, as long as it contains a disclaimer stating that it is a dramatization. 
b. Yes, as long as it accurately portrays the outcome of the case it is based on.
c. No, because it may create an unjustified expectation about the results Attorney could achieve for other clients.

Aunt hires Lawyer to represent Nephew, who is charged with a crime. Aunt agrees to pay all of Nephew's legal fees and Nephew consents to the arrangement. On the eve of trial, the prosecution offers a deal under which Nephew would plead guilty to a lesser charge, with probation instead of a prison sentence. Lawyer advised Nephew to accept the plea deal, as the prosecution had a very strong case. Nephew agreed and called Aunt to tell her. Aunt immediately called Lawyer and told him, "I don't want Nephew to take this deal. Anything other than an acquittal will bring shame on our entire family. You convince him to go to trial, or I'm not paying you one dime!" Worried about not getting paid, Lawyer calls Nephew and tells him, "After giving it some more thought, I don't think you should take the plea." Nephew agrees, and Lawyer informs the prosecutor that Nephew has rejected the plea offer.
 
Is Lawyer subject to discipline?
 
a. No, if Client is ultimately acquitted.
b. No, if Lawyer's representation of Client was competent
c. Yes, because he allowed Aunt to control his professional judgment.
d. Yes, if Client is convicted.

### Question 24

Lawyer represents Client, who is charged with attempted murder. The case has attracted a great deal of media attention. Following Client's arraignment, Lawyer spoke to reporters outside the courthouse. In response to a question about what he thought would happen in the case, Lawyer said, "We're confident of an acquittal. The state's entire case centers on the testimony of one witness, Jones, a notorious liar who's trying to avoid his own prosecution."

Is Lawyer subject to discipline?
 
a. No, if the Lawyer's statements were true.
b. No, because the trial has not yet begun.
c. Yes, but only if the judge had previously issued an order restricting statements to the press.
d. Yes, because Lawyer identified and impugned the credibility of a witness
 
### Question 25

A recently-enacted state law makes it a crime to wear white pants in public between Labor Day and Memorial Day. Client's religion requires all adherents to wear all white clothing as a sign of moral purity. Concerned about the implications of the new law, which contains no exception for religious requirements, Client contacts Lawyer for advice. Lawyer tells Client, "This ordinance is absurd and discriminatory. Just keep wearing white pants and if they arrest you, you can challenge the statute as unconstitutional." Following Lawyer's advice, Client goes out wearing his usual white pants the day after Labor Day and is arrested for violating the state law.
 
Is Lawyer subject to discipline?
 
a. No, because the ordinance was unconstitutional.
b. No, because a lawyer may assist a client in a good faith test of the validity a law.
c. Yes, if Client is found guilty.
d. Yes, because Lawyer advised his client to break the law.

\newpage

### Question 26

Before attending law school, Lawyer had spent several happy years working in a traveling carnival. After a decade of legal practice, Lawyer yearned for the adventures of carnival life. He approached the carnival's owner and proposed the following business arrangement: The carnival owner and Lawyer would be partners, with the carnival owner managing the carnival operations and Lawyer operating a traveling law office. Lawyer would represent carnival employees in any legal matters at a reduced rate, and would also be free to accept other clients at Lawyer's usual rates. Lawyer would pay a share of the carnival's operating expenses, and the carnival owner would receive a share of any legal fees received. Lawyer is admitted to practice in every jurisdiction that the carnival visits.
 
Is Lawyer subject to discipline?
 
a. Yes, unless the carnival owner is also a lawyer.
b. Yes, because practicing law as part of a carnival undermines the integrity of the legal profession.

d. No, provided the terms of the arrangement are fair and Lawyer gives the carnival owner an opportunity to obtain independent legal counsel.

### Question 27

Client meets with Attorney about a complex litigation matter. Attorney agrees to take Client's case on a contingent fee basis, with Attorney to receive one-third of any amount recovered on behalf of Client. 
 
Just a few days after the initial meeting, Attorney falls seriously ill. He calls Client and explains that he will be unable to continue working. Attorney says that he has a friend, Lawyer, who is highly experienced in the relevant area of law, and that Attorney intends to refer some of his pending matters to Lawyer. Attorney arranges a meeting with Client and Lawyer, after which Client agrees to have Lawyer take over the case from Attorney. Client further agrees that Attorney and Lawyer will each receive one-sixth of any recovery obtained on behalf of Client. 
 
Is Lawyer subject to discipline?
 
a. No, because Client agreed to Lawyer's involvement in the representation.
b. No, because Lawyer is accepting less than he was originally entitled to receive.
c. Yes, because Attorney is receiving a disproportionate share of the fee.
d. Yes, because Lawyer is not a member of Attorney's firm.

### Question 28

Client is stopped for speeding. The police officer detects the smell of marijuana and searches the car, discovering a large bag of marijuana under the passenger seat. Client is arrested for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. Client's mother hires Lawyer to represent Client and tells Lawyer she will pay Client's legal fees. Lawyer meets with Client, who tells him that the marijuana belonged to his brother, who has several previous convictions and faces a long prison sentence if he's convicted again. To protect his brother, Client, who has a clean record, is prepared to plead guilty, as long as he doesn't have to serve jail time. Lawyer believes the prosecution is likely to offer such a deal, but doesn't think Client should plead guilty to a crime he didn't commit. After Client leaves, Lawyer calls Client's mother and tells her that Client is planning to take the rap for his brother. 

Is Lawyer subject to discipline?
 
a. Yes, for violating the duty of confidentiality.
b. Yes, for allowing someone other than Client to pay Client's legal fees.
c. No, because he is trying to prevent Client from pleading guilty to a crime he did not commit.
d. No, because Client's mother is paying Client's legal fees.

### Question 29

Attorney represents Client in a personal injury suit. Attorney's written fee agreement (signed by Client) provides that Attorney would receive 25% of any recovery. Client accepts Defendant's offer of $200,000 to settle the case. The settlement agreement gives Defendant 90 days to pay the full amount. Two weeks after the settlement agreement is signed, Defendant sends a check for $100,000 to Attorney's office. Attorney promptly deposits the check into the checking account he maintained for office expenses. Eight weeks later, Defendant sends a check for the remaining $100,000 to Attorney, who again immediately deposits the check into the same account. Two weeks later (90 days after the settlement agreement was signed), Attorney wrote the following checks on his office expense account: $150,000 to Client and $50,000 to Attorney's personal checking account.
 
Is Attorney subject to discipline?
 
a. Yes, for commingling Client's funds with his own funds.
b. Yes, for commingling Client's funds with his own and holding Client's funds without notice and for too long.
c. No, because Client received the full amount due under the settlement and the fee agreement.
d. No, as long as Attorney did not use any of the settlement funds to pay business expenses.

### Question 30

Patient had an unsightly wart on her chin. Three times, she had the wart surgically removed by Doctor, but each time it grew back within a few weeks. Patient sued Doctor for medical malpractice. Lawyer represented Doctor in Patient's suit. In the course of investigating the case, Lawyer learned that the standard treatment included application of a prescription ointment following the surgery, but that Doctor had failed to prescribe the ointment. Lawyer thus concluded that Doctor was likely to lose if the case went to trial. A week before trial, Patient's attorney called Lawyer with an offer to settle the case for $5,000. Lawyer believed this was far less than a jury was likely to award, and immediately accepted the offer on behalf of Doctor.
 
Is Lawyer subject to discipline?
 
a. Yes, because Lawyer accepted the offer without consulting with Doctor. 
b. Yes, because Doctor might still have prevailed at trial.
c. No, because there was a risk that Patient would rescind the offer if Lawyer did not accept immediately.
d. No, if Lawyer reasonably believed $5,000 was a reasonable settlement amount.

### Question 31
 
Attorney practices elder law. She regularly volunteers to give free seminars on elder law through civic organizations or churches. At the seminars, Attorney is careful to discuss issues in general and scrupulously avoids giving legal advice on any specific matter. She reminds those attending that they should have a will and that they should have an attorney prepare the will for them. She gives the phone number for the local bar association and suggests contacting that organization for referrals to local attorneys. Attorney never specifically recommends other attorneys nor does she ever recommend herself. Each time Attorney gives a seminar, she routinely gets calls from several attendees who want her to prepare or update their wills.
 
Is Attorney subject to discipline?
 
a. Yes, because she has engaged in improper solicitation.
b. Yes, because the seminars are intended to serve as advertisements for Attorney's service.
c. No, because Attorney was not seeking to gain legal employment by speaking with individual listeners.
d. No, but only because Attorney referred listeners to the local bar association.

### Question 32

Attorney recently graduated from law school and passed the bar exam. Before going to law school, Attorney was a dentist and he has many friends who are dentists. He contacted some of hid dentist friends and tells them, "If you refer your patients to me who are in need of legal services, I will retain you as an expert witness in all of my dental malpractice cases."

Is Attorney subject to discipline?
 
a. Yes, because the agreement allows non-lawyers to practice law.
b. Yes, because the agreement involves Attorney giving something of value in exchange for referrals.
c. No, but only if Attorney does not share any legal fees with the dentists.
d. No, because Attorney receives a bigger benefit in this Agreement than the dentists.

### Question 33

Client has had a bad back for many years, but never sought medical treatment for his pain. Last month, he was in a car accident that temporarily exacerbated his pre-existing back troubles. Within a few days, Client's back felt the same as it did prior to the accident. But the experience prompted Client to want treatment for his back pain. So he hired Attorney to represent him in a suit against the other driver in the car accident, hoping he would get some money to pay for physical therapy.
